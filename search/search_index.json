Where will SNApps and all of its data be hosted? Loki Services \u00b6 What's Loki Messenger? General \u00b6 What is Loki? \u00b6 Loki provides users with tools to interact online in an anonymous, decentralised, secure and private way. By combining a private transaction network, the $LOKI cryptocurrency, economically incentivised Service Nodes , Loki is able to create a trustless quorum based mixnet called Lokinet . Built into Lokinet is Loki Messenger - a decentralised, anonymous and private messaging service. Front end applications, known as Service Node Apps (SNApps) operate on Lokinet, and will allow browser integration and contribution from our open-source community. Is Loki Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Service (PoS)? \u00b6 Loki uses a hybrid of Proof of Work and Proof of Service , similar to how DASH is secured by PoW but also has a reward for their masternodes through a Proof of Service. What is the token supply? \u00b6 Like Monero, there is no total token supply. The current supply can be seen at lokiblocks.com . What do you do differently from Monero? \u00b6 Aside from some minor changes in approach to the core currency, we implement a Service Node network that performs a variety of functions, including an anonymous networking layer , trustless quorum-based instant transactions through a system called \" Blink \", and a range of functions that leverage the networking layer to do things like secure private messaging . Who would use Loki Network? \u00b6 Loki provides both private transaction and private communication functionality, so the use case presents itself to users who want the highest level of privacy in their communication channels. As more SNApps are developed we imagine Loki will present it self as the network to run privacy-centric applications on top of. Is Loki an ERC20 token? \u00b6 It is not an ERC20 token. Loki is its own coin running its own mainnet. See lokiblocks.com Why the name Loki? \u00b6 Loki is the Norse god of trickery. This is fitting as we use a lot of digital 'tricks' to obfuscate transactional data. Also, it is a play on words as transactions and communications on the network are very 'Low-Key'. What is the business model behind this peer-to-peer network? \u00b6 Loki operates on an incentives structure provided by the network. Peer-to-peer communications only occurs through the Service Node layer which is already incentivised to run so there is less of an incentive to provide any additional businesses models. The business model post-launch for the Loki foundation is to continue to build both core Loki Services and aid in the development of 3rd party SNApps which Service nodes can optionally operate. Will you guys commit back to the monero source code? \u00b6 Loki plans to push back any useful changes to Monero, such as optimizations, bug fixes, and feature adds. What's the difference from Monero? \u00b6 Fixed ring size with minimum mixin of 10, governance block reward of 5% which will fund community projects and developments , and emission curve changes . These are baselayer changes that will differentiate us between Monero, however the main change that is being implemented is the second layer of incentivised Service Nodes , Loki Services , and Lokinet . Can I see details about the premine? \u00b6 Yes, see the premine report . Why is there a 5% governance reward? \u00b6 We intended to create a self-funding system so that users can be certain that no external influences drive the development funding of the network in an undesirable direction. The 5% block reward that is issued to the governance wallet is for this purpose. This is a similar approach to other projects, such as the Zcash Foundation, who for the first 4 years of the network\u2019s operation will receive a 20% block reward, and the DASH project, who receive a 10% block reward from the network. We wanted to keep the amount significantly less than Zcash and DASH but want to make sure that it is enough to sustain the project indefinitely. In the future, the community may decide that this reward is unnecessary or of too high or too low a proportion, in which case, a hard fork event may change the nature of this block reward split. What is the block reward for mining? \u00b6 The exact block reward can be found at www.lokiblocks.com , this block reward is split where 50% of the block reward goes to service nodes, 45% to miners, 5% to the governance pool. You can see more details on the block reward split here What is the block generation time? \u00b6 About 120 seconds. Are there plans to support Loki on the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet? \u00b6 Yes, it is in the works. Service Nodes \u00b6 Why are Service Nodes required? \u00b6 The Service Nodes form a second layer network that allows for anonymous networking using a novel garlic routing technology. Service Nodes will route data being passed through our generalised mixnet, called Lokinet . SNApps are the front-end user-facing applications enabled by this network of Nodes. SNApps do not run on the blockchain, but rely on the consensus rules of the blockchain to enforce Service Node behaviours. This also means that SNApps do not impact blockchain scalabilty. Service Nodes don't mine blocks but do propagate and validate blocks like regular full nodes. Is there a concept of 'Masternodes' in Loki? \u00b6 Yes, they are called Service Nodes in Loki. What is the collateral requirement to run Service Nodes? \u00b6 The initial requirement is 45K $LOKI, though this will adjust downward over time. Pools are also allowed up to 4 people. For more Information on the collateral requirement click here . Check out the collateral calculator here for the current requirement. You can either run a single node or join a pooled node. For a single node, you will need the full collateral. For a pooled node, the operator and all but one of the 4 contributors must have at least 25% of the required total collateral. See more details on service nodes in the Service Node Portal . Can you run multiple service nodes in a single VPS server? \u00b6 It is recomended that you run different instances per Service Node however it is not required.. Can a pool member request for the stake to be unlocked? \u00b6 In pooled nodes, any contributor that requests the stake to unlock will schedule the Service Node for expiration. SNapps \u00b6 Do SNApps run on Service Nodes only? \u00b6 When accessing a SNApp your data is obfuscated by being routed through multiple Service Nodes. The SNApp you are accessing however is hosted on servers, similar to hidden services in Tor and are computed client-side. Are SNApps like DApps? \u00b6 In the sense that their core function is 'decentralised,' yes. However, unlike most DApps, SNApps do not rely on on-chain execution or computation. All SNApps are computed client-side, and the networking is handled offchain by the Service Node network. Where will SNApps and all of its data be hosted? \u00b6 SNApps are similar to hidden services in Tor; they are hosted on servers by users. Loki Services \u00b6 What's Loki Messenger? \u00b6 Loki Messenger will be a decentralised, end-to-end encrypted private messaging service. There are already applications that provide a platform for users to send messages without revealing their contents, however they rely on centralised servers that governments or third parties can target. By leveraging the power of public-private key cryptography and the Service Node architecture on the Loki network, we can create a service similar to Signal, a secure messaging application with the added benefit of decentralisation and network anonymity.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"FAQ/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"FAQ/#general","text":"What is Loki?

In the case of a digital currency like Bitcoin and its many derivatives merchant payment systems will usually create a new recipient address for each payment or user. However, because Loki has stealth addresses there is no need to have separate recipient addresses for each payment or user, and a single account address can be published. Instead, when receiving payments a merchant will provide the person paying with a payment ID . A payment ID is a hexadecimal string that is 64 characters long, and is normally randomly created by the merchant. An example of a payment ID is: 326d381588ae509bcf35fc8ae05abd31ba1ef885ced2e5c1f2180f28845d1f6f To generate a payment ID in loki-wallet-cli run the command: payment_id Checking for a Payment in loki-wallet-cli \u00b6 If you want to check for a payment using loki-wallet-cli you can use the payments command followed by the payment ID or payment IDs you want to check: payments <PID_1> [<PID_2> ... <PID_N>] For example: [wallet L6k67F]: payments 4c746dff9f666d6275a60eb6ecbe5078970d5207bc104032f5afa4878eb414e6 payment transaction height amount unlock time addr index <4c746dff9f666d6275a60eb6ecbe5078970d5207bc104032f5afa4878eb414e6> <3fc266d4167060613fba401c65e22e7f01e00045070009b99dd15134b60b47e9> 191878 1.000000000 0 0 [wallet L6k67F]: If you need to check for payments programmatically, then follow the next section . Receiving a Payment Step-by-Step \u00b6 Generate a random 64 character hexadecimal string for the payment Communicate the payment ID and Loki address to the individual who is making payment Check for the payment using the \"payments\" command in loki-wallet-cli Checking for a Payment Programmatically \u00b6 In order to check for a payment programmatically you can use the get_payments or get_bulk_payments JSON RPC API calls. get_payments : this requires a payment_id parameter with a single payment ID. get_bulk_payments : this is the preferred method, and requires two parameters, payment_ids - a JSON array of payment IDs - and an optional min_block_height - the block height to scan from. get_payments \u00b6 Get a list of incoming payments using a given payment id. Alias : None. Inputs : payment_id - string; Payment ID used to find the payments (16 characters hex). Outputs : payments - list of: payment_id - string; Payment ID matching the input parameter. tx_hash - string; Transaction hash used as the transaction ID. amount - unsigned int; Amount for this payment. block_height - unsigned int; Height of the block that first confirmed this payment. unlock_time - unsigned int; Time (in block height) until this payment is safe to spend. subaddr_index - subaddress index: major - unsigned int; Account index for the subaddress. minor - unsigned int; Index of the subaddress in the account. address - string; Address receiving the payment; Base58 representation of the public keys. Example : $ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18082/json_rpc -d '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":\"0\",\"method\":\"get_payments\",\"params\":{\"payment_id\":\"4c746dff9f666d6275a60eb6ecbe5078970d5207bc104032f5afa4878eb414e6\"}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' { \"id\": \"0\", \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"result\": { \"payments\": [{ \"address\": \"LTyHcisBFCGQ6nU3D8wtMj5nr9yZfVBqE5pzrKQak5abBPFMx21r5V57UT33hzzzyLA8yaJFyrcj7iJwiQ8Z1zPeK1a7tpo\", \"amount\": 1000000000000, \"block_height\": 127606, \"payment_id\": \"4c746dff9f666d6275a60eb6ecbe5078970d5207bc104032f5afa4878eb414e6\", \"subaddr_index\": { \"major\": 0, \"minor\": 0 }, \"tx_hash\": \"3fc266d4167060613fba401c65e22e7f01e00045070009b99dd15134b60b47e9\", \"unlock_time\": 0 }] } } get_bulk_payments \u00b6 Get a list of incoming payments using a given payment id, or a list of payments ids, from a given height. This method is the preferred method over get_payments because it has the same functionality but is more extendable. Either is fine for looking up transactions by a single payment ID. Alias : None. Inputs : payment_ids - array of: string; Payment IDs used to find the payments (16 characters hex). min_block_height - unsigned int; The block height at which to start looking for payments. Outputs : payments - list of: payment_id - string; Payment ID matching one of the input IDs. tx_hash - string; Transaction hash used as the transaction ID. amount - unsigned int; Amount for this payment. block_height - unsigned int; Height of the block that first confirmed this payment. unlock_time - unsigned int; Time (in block height) until this payment is safe to spend. subaddr_index - subaddress index: major - unsigned int; Account index for the subaddress. minor - unsigned int; Index of the subaddress in the account. address - string; Address receiving the payment; Base58 representation of the public keys. Example : $ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18082/json_rpc -d '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":\"0\",\"method\":\"get_bulk_payments\",\"params\":{\"payment_ids\":[\"60900e5603bf96e3\"],\"min_block_height\":\"120000\"}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' { \"id\": \"0\", \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"result\": { \"payments\": [{ \"address\": \"LTyHcisBFCGQ6nU3D8wtMj5nr9yZfVBqE5pzrKQak5abBPFMx21r5V57UT33hzzzyLA8yaJFyrcj7iJwiQ8Z1zPeK1a7tpo\", \"amount\": 1000000000000, \"block_height\": 127606, \"payment_id\": \"4c746dff9f666d6275a60eb6ecbe5078970d5207bc104032f5afa4878eb414e6\", \"subaddr_index\": { \"major\": 0, \"minor\": 0 }, \"tx_hash\": \"3fc266d4167060613fba401c65e22e7f01e00045070009b99dd15134b60b47e9\", \"unlock_time\": 0 }] } } It is important to note that the amounts returned are in base Loki units and not in the display units normally used in end-user applications. Also, since a transaction will typically have multiple outputs that add up to the total required for the payment, the amounts should be grouped by the tx_hash or the payment_id and added together. Additionally, as multiple outputs can have the same amount, it is imperative not to try and filter out the returned data from a single get_bulk_payments call. Before scanning for payments it is useful to check against the daemon RPC API (the get_info RPC call) to see if additional blocks have been received. Typically you would want to then scan only from that received block on by specifying it as the min_block_height to get_bulk_payments . Programatically Scanning for Payments \u00b6 Get the current block height from the daemon, only proceed if it has increased since our last scan.

To mitigate this risk and increase security, Loki should leverage the existing Service Node network and integrate Service Nodes more closely into our consensus mechanism. This proposal, if passed, would allow Service Nodes to validate the existing PoW chain to prevent reorganisations of the blockchain greater than N blocks. 2 Abstract \u00b6 Loki currently only uses Proof of Work to come to consensus on the state of the blockchain. Although the introduction of Service Nodes has removed a portion of the block reward from miners, Service Nodes do not create, verify or submit blocks to the network. Proof of Work is a well studied system for forming decentralised consensus, but a number of issues persist, especially for coins with lower market capitalisations. These issues include but are not limited to: Roaming hashrate attacks, Monopooling, and rented hashrate attacks. This proposal presents novel attacks on Loki\u2019s Proof of Work consensus system and proposes Service Node block validation to prevent this. 3 Motivation \u00b6 Proof of Work\u2019s intrinsic value in a blockchain system is derived from its ability to fairly choose who can update the blockchain. Each block requires proof that the block creator has spent some resource that is external to the blockchain itself. Although Proof of Work does well to satisfy the above claims, it also has some major drawbacks. The most pressing for Loki is that of a 51% attack, which would seek to perform a double spend by producing a chain with more proof of work than a canonical chain. Typically when referring to 51% attacks they are strictly theoretical, either requiring unreasonable amounts of money or large amounts of economically disincentivised social collusion. However there are a number of factors which make lower market cap coins like Loki particularly susceptible to 51% attacks. The first being the \u2018roaming hashrate phenomenon,\u2019 which refers to the propensity for miners to quickly move hashrate across networks seeking the most profitable coins, this can create large fluctuations in hashrate which are difficult to control for. Secondly, there are \u2018rented hash power attacks,\u2019 a relatively new phenomena which have seen wide proliferation through services like NiceHash and MiningRigRentals. These services allow users to temporarily rent hashing power for a number of popular hashing algorithms[1][2]. Rented hash attacks become a significant threat when the hashrate available on these services exceeds the hashrate of the minable coin. Finally there is \u2018monopooling,\u2019 which is a complex problem where a large number of miners tend to mine only to the largest pool regardless of the fee structure of that pool. This is often a symptom of the roaming hashrate phoneomenon. If a monopool reaches more than 51% of the network hashrate then it becomes a risk factor for general 51% attacks occurring. These attacks will now be discussed in further detail. 3.1 PoW Disadvantages \u00b6 3.1.1 Roaming Hashrate Phenomenon \u00b6 To understand this phenomenon, it is best to imagine a portion of the \u201cglobal GPU hashrate\u201d as liquid in nature. This hashrate moves between coins based on their short term profitability. This means coins which have a spike in price or a large reduction in difficulty are often mined for short periods of time by this type of miner. The roaming hashrate phenomenon has increased in scale with the adoption of websites which allow miners to easily analyse the profitability of every minable coin live depending on their hardware, and make recommendations on the most profitable coin to mine[3][4][5]. Additionally, developers have created open source utilities which allow a miner\u2019s hashrate to automatically switch between different coins depending on profitability, entirely without user interaction[6]. Figure 1: CryptonightProfitSwitcher CLI utility that automatically targets mining rigs to most profitable CryptoNight coin. Although these miners are not necessarily intending to negatively impact coins, they can further exacerbate deep cycles of hashrate fluctuation when they switch between networks. These deep cycles can be exploited by attackers, either by controlling pools that these miners automatically switch to, or using rented hashing power attacks when profit seeking miners switch off creating a temporary drop in the network hashrate. If done programmatically, the roaming hashrate phenomenon can also contribute to the monopooling phenomenon. 3.1.2 Rented Hashrate Attacks \u00b6 Although the phenomenon of the roaming hashrate would generally be considered as benign and lacking malicious intent, rented hashrate attacks often carry a much greater negative stigma. There have been numerous examples of attackers using rented hashrate to perform a wide variety of attacks, including timestamp forging, difficulty jamming and double spend attacks[7][8][9]. Figure 2 : example of a hashrate attack causing difficulty jamming on the Karbowanec network The proliferation of services like NiceHash and MiningRigRentals make the renting of hashrate easy to even the most basic of attacker. Although the same 51% attacks have always been possible, attackers previously would either have to permanently purchase hardware totaling 51% of the network hashrate, or convince miners to use their malicious pool. These options typically involved large setup costs in hardware, time, or social efforts (and often all three). Miners can now spontaneously set up a private pool with modified malicious software, then rent the needed hashrate to perform a double spend with relative ease. Although this specific issue has not directly affected Loki, there have been notable attacks on a number of Cryptonote coins. This attack becomes easier as the hashing algorithm becomes more available and liquid on NiceHash relative to a coin network\u2019s actual hashrate. This comes as a particular concern for Loki as we have repeatedly lowered rewards for miners which has reduced the network hashrate and led to a significant amount of hashrate moving to more profitable coins. Any plans to increase rewards for Service Nodes further may continue this effect, further reducing the Loki hashrate. This trend is illustrated in figure 3, which shows a trend of growing convergence between Nicehash available hashing power and Loki\u2019s global hashrate. Figure 3: Available NiceHash CryptoNight heavy hashing power versus the Global hashing power of at Loki. 3.1.3 Monopooling \u00b6 We will use the term \u2018monopooling,\u2019 which refers to single pools which dominate more than 51% of the hashrate of a coin\u2019s network. This is a phenomenon which mostly affects small, GPU-mineable coins. The monopools themselves are not necessarily malicious, although provided the right incentive from an attacker they can exert their hashrate over a coin network. Monopooling seems to be the culmination of many of the above phenomenon, being particularly endemic in coins that have issues with roaming hashrate. If we consider a miner who switches between profitable coins using the CryptoNight hashing algorithm, they might switch networks multiple times a day. The most profitable strategy for this miner is not always to seek the pool with the lowest fees, but to join a pool which will will produce more blocks and yield a higher payout in the short time that they are mining. This reduces the variance during the time that they do mine, ensuring that hashes are seldom wasted. If these pools reach over 50% of the hashrate they can also offer advantages to miners. For example in the event of a hard fork, the community and developers of a coin may seek to legitimise the longest chain as the the legitimate chain meaning profits are unlikely to be lost in a split. On a number of coins this leads to large monopools. By measuring the percentage hashrate of the largest pools of 18 small GPU-mineable coins the results indicated that on average these coins had a single pool that represented 53% of their hashrate. Figure 4: Shows the % network hashrate of the largest pool on a number of GPU mineable coins as of 01/12/2018 Although these pools are primarily benign, they still pose a threat due to the control they have over the network. It would be feasible for an attacker to bribe or hack a pool operator to perform a double spend. 4 Specification \u00b6 4.1 Block Validation \u00b6 As a result of the above problems, I propose that Loki utilise Service Nodes to validate the existing Proof of Work chain after N blocks. 4.2 Reorganisation Limits \u00b6 \u2018Checkpoints\u2019 are one way to prevent reorganisations greater than N blocks. Adding a checkpoint to a blockchain dictates that once the checkpoint is reached, the normal rules of Proof of Work are ignored. This means that when a checkpoint is set, block reorganisations past the checkpoint are invalid, even if the proposed candidate for reorganisation contains a longer chain with higher difficulty targets. The other, more naive approach is to simply cap reorganisations greater than P blocks. However there are serious problems with this approach, if an attacker can produce a chain of length P +1 and submit it to a different edge of the network as the non attacking chain is being checkpointed, then the network will diverge and will be unable to merge back into a single chain, effectively permanently forking the chain. This attack could, for example, deliberately target an exchange to put the exchange on a fork controlled by the attacker but distinct from the main network until manual maintenance is undertaken by the exchange to re-sync to the proper network chain. This kind of attack is prevented by Service Node checkpointing, as the attacker would need their two chains to be signed by the quorum to create a conflict. 4.3 Checkpointing Rules \u00b6 Already implemented in Loki are Service Node quorums , which dictate that each block 10 random Service Nodes are selected based on the hash of the 10th previous block to assess the uptime proofs of other Service Nodes. To validate the blockchain every N blocks a new class of Service Node quorums should be selected and be given an additional task, which is to add a checkpoint to the blockchain each time a period N is reached. A Service Node checkpoint should consist of a blockhash, a block height and the signature of a super majority (66%) of the Service Nodes in the relevant quorum. To avoid miners colluding to ignore checkpoints and reorg past the hard limits, the checkpoint should not be included as a transaction in the blockchain. Rather, the checkpoint data should be appended to the \u2018top\u2019 of the block after the fact. All data inside of blocks will maintain immutability, but clients will append the Service Node data outside of the hashed data. Figure 5: example of a Checkpointed block Choosing Chains \u00b6 A Service Node quorum is prevented from checkpointing more than one chain at any time, so behaviour must be written for what should occur when the quorum disagrees on which chain should be checkpointed. First, before any decision is made, each node should share their candidate checkpoint chain with all other nodes in the quorum. Some conditions should be established beyond normal block validation: The proposed chain must be built from one of the last two checkpoints C1 or C2 ; Nodes shall not accept more than ( N *3) - 1 blocks since the last checkpoint (Where N is the reorg limit); If two chains of proof of work are produced with the same cumulative difficulty, Service Nodes should choose the chain based on the lowest hamming distance of the chain tip\u2019s blockhash to 0, and; The latest checkpoint C3 can invalidate two checkpoints back to C1 . Once Service Nodes internally agree on the correct chain, they should all produce a signed copy of the block which should then be submitted to the network. If valid (containing a super majority of Service Node signatures) then the extra Service Node data should be appended to the relevant checkpointed block in all client databases. Why Have More Than One Checkpoint? \u00b6 Adding additional checkpoints to the chain before finalisation adds a high degree of redundancy: in the rare case that a quorum is unable to come to consensus and misses a checkpoint, the chain can continue uninterrupted. The network will then rely on either of the next two quorums which can sign and continue the chain. Service Node Data \u00b6 As discussed, each checkpoint requires that data be appended to the top of blocks. This data should include a couple of things: The blockhash of one of the last two checkpointed blocks; The Service Node data hash of one of the last two checkpointed blocks, and; A super majority of the selected quorum signatures singing the blockhash of the new block to be checkpointed. Practical Issues with Checkpointing \u00b6 When checkpointing or setting reorganisation limits, the question must always be asked: can the blockchain self repair, and in what situation could the blockchain become stuck or permanently forked? If we imagine a protocol bug that causes the blockchain to stop after a reorganisation point or an invalid block is checkpointed, then there is no way to continue the chain, since the longer chain can never reorganise past the first checkpoint on chain 1 as shown in figure 6. Figure 6: Blockchain with unrepairable checkpoints, N = 4 The only way to overcome this issue is to allow Service Nodes to simultaneously sign multiple chains. Clients must measure the dominant chain as the one with the most Service Node signatures. However, this reintroduces the risk of a double spend as Service Nodes can now authorise duplicate chains outside of N . Figure 7: Blockchain as measured by signature weight This leads us to the conclusion that chain reparability and double spend protection are mutually exclusive, since any transactions that were accepted in chain 1 (figure 7) could be reversed in chain 2. 4.4 Proposed Checkpointing in Loki \u00b6 After assessing the above issues I believe Loki should value double spend protection over absolute chain repariablity for a couple of reasons: Chain reparability is already a problem present in Loki\u2019s current PoW. If a chain of blocks is mined and then there is a bug encountered, then that bug is likely to cause an issue for all miners, in this case the Loki team or a third party would have to release new software which would allow miners and clients to sync past the faulty block. This would be the same scenario if an invalid block was to be checkpointed. Thus the introduction of checkpoints doesn\u2019t significantly impact the potential consequences of a bug that causes a chain pause. An active double spend on the Loki network is likely to cause more damage to the ecosystem than a temporary chain pause. Double spends can shake confidence and erode the trust of users and merchants which accept and exchange Loki, a chain pause may be a lower impact event, since no funds are lost and merchants/exchanges can resume normally after the pause. 4.5 Rewards and Consequences \u00b6 This LIP does not seek to increase the Service Node block reward, however it would add additional conditions to a Service Node receiving its normal portion of the block rewards. The primary things we want to prevent Service Nodes from doing are: Checkpointing more than one chain; Checkpointing a chain that defies the consensus of the Service Node quorum, and; Failing to sign any chain despite being in a selected Service Node quorum. The first and second rules can be easily detected by allowing Service Nodes to submit any Service Node\u2019s signature as evidence for a deregistration transaction if the signature conflicts with an existing onchain checkpoint. Rule 3 can be solved by investigating each checkpoint for all Service Node signatures. Because Service Node quorum selection is deterministic, if any checkpoint is missing a Service Node signature more than once, the next quorum should have the ability to vote that non-voting Service Node off the network through a deregistration transaction. 4.6 Setting N \u00b6 N is the depth of the chain before checkpointing occurs. The appropriate N should consider the propensity of natural reorganisations in the Loki blockchain, which happen to occur at a rate of approximately 20 per 10,000 blocks and at an average reorg height of 1.3 blocks. We should also consider the time it will take for a Service Node to actually checkpoint the chain. Currently, processing votes for deregistration takes approximately 1-2 blocks. Taking this into account I propose we set N = 4. In the future we should consider lowering this time if we have good reason to do so. 4.7 DDoS Protection \u00b6 Because Service Node quorums are deterministically selected before checkpointing blocks and Service Node IP addresses are publicly stored on a DHT in Lokinet, it is important to consider an attacker who would seek to disrupt consensus communications. Without protections an attacker could carry out a DDoS attack as Service Nodes were checkpointing the chain in an attempt to disrupt communications and prevent the chain from successfully being checkpointed. Because a super majority of quorum signatures is required to sign a block and the quorum size is 20, the attack would only need to prevent communication of 18 nodes over the course of two consecutive checkpoints to freeze the blockchain. The novel protection for this attack is Service Nodes having the ability to whitelist other nodes inside of their own active quorum when Service Nodes detects an attack. Practically speaking, Service Nodes would turn on this protection automatically when the previous quorum has failed to sign a block. This method allows nodes to communicate and come to consensus on the correct chain to sign, without accepting connections from unknown IP addresses potentially attempting DDoS attacks. Once finished checkpointing the quorum should again regain normal functionality. 4.8 Considerations for Merchants and Exchanges \u00b6 An RPC call should be added to the Loki daemon to indicate the state of the current chain\u2019s checkpoints. This RPC call will indicate the height of the last four blocks which were checkpointed. Merchants can with an extremely high degree of certainty accept any chain with more than two checkpoints and with a high degree of certainty accept a chain that has received a single checkpoint from a Service Node quorum. Any block deeper than 12 blocks in the chain that has more than three checkpoints should then be considered final and cannot be reorganised. If two checkpoints have been missed in a row, this RPC call should indicate that there may be a serious error on the network and the merchant/exchange should disable withdrawals deposits temporarily while investigating the state of the chain. Backwards Capability \u00b6 The Switch \u00b6 This proposal is not backwards compatible and will require a hard fork to enact. As stated, this change introduces a significant alteration to the way we will measure consensus on the Loki chain. Before making this change we should thoroughly discuss the potential consequences and recognise opposing opinions. Implementation \u00b6 This LIP will be opened for public discussion prior to a Foundation vote. If the vote is successful, the code will be written and submitted as a pull request which will be open to community review. These developments shall be linked here as they occur.

The roaming hashrate phenomenon has increased in scale with the adoption of websites which allow miners to easily analyse the profitability of every minable coin live depending on their hardware, and make recommendations on the most profitable coin to mine[3][4][5]. Additionally, developers have created open source utilities which allow a miner\u2019s hashrate to automatically switch between different coins depending on profitability, entirely without user interaction[6]. Figure 1: CryptonightProfitSwitcher CLI utility that automatically targets mining rigs to most profitable CryptoNight coin. Although these miners are not necessarily intending to negatively impact coins, they can further exacerbate deep cycles of hashrate fluctuation when they switch between networks. These deep cycles can be exploited by attackers, either by controlling pools that these miners automatically switch to, or using rented hashing power attacks when profit seeking miners switch off creating a temporary drop in the network hashrate. If done programmatically, the roaming hashrate phenomenon can also contribute to the monopooling phenomenon.","title":"3.1.1 Roaming Hashrate Phenomenon"},{"location":"Advanced/CheckpointingLip3/#312-rented-hashrate-attacks","text":"Although the phenomenon of the roaming hashrate would generally be considered as benign and lacking malicious intent, rented hashrate attacks often carry a much greater negative stigma. There have been numerous examples of attackers using rented hashrate to perform a wide variety of attacks, including timestamp forging, difficulty jamming and double spend attacks[7][8][9]. Figure 2 : example of a hashrate attack causing difficulty jamming on the Karbowanec network The proliferation of services like NiceHash and MiningRigRentals make the renting of hashrate easy to even the most basic of attacker. Although the same 51% attacks have always been possible, attackers previously would either have to permanently purchase hardware totaling 51% of the network hashrate, or convince miners to use their malicious pool. These options typically involved large setup costs in hardware, time, or social efforts (and often all three). Miners can now spontaneously set up a private pool with modified malicious software, then rent the needed hashrate to perform a double spend with relative ease. Although this specific issue has not directly affected Loki, there have been notable attacks on a number of Cryptonote coins. This attack becomes easier as the hashing algorithm becomes more available and liquid on NiceHash relative to a coin network\u2019s actual hashrate. This comes as a particular concern for Loki as we have repeatedly lowered rewards for miners which has reduced the network hashrate and led to a significant amount of hashrate moving to more profitable coins. Any plans to increase rewards for Service Nodes further may continue this effect, further reducing the Loki hashrate. This trend is illustrated in figure 3, which shows a trend of growing convergence between Nicehash available hashing power and Loki\u2019s global hashrate. Figure 3: Available NiceHash CryptoNight heavy hashing power versus the Global hashing power of at Loki.","title":"3.1.2 Rented Hashrate Attacks"},{"location":"Advanced/CheckpointingLip3/#313-monopooling","text":"We will use the term \u2018monopooling,\u2019 which refers to single pools which dominate more than 51% of the hashrate of a coin\u2019s network. This is a phenomenon which mostly affects small, GPU-mineable coins. The monopools themselves are not necessarily malicious, although provided the right incentive from an attacker they can exert their hashrate over a coin network. Monopooling seems to be the culmination of many of the above phenomenon, being particularly endemic in coins that have issues with roaming hashrate. If we consider a miner who switches between profitable coins using the CryptoNight hashing algorithm, they might switch networks multiple times a day. The most profitable strategy for this miner is not always to seek the pool with the lowest fees, but to join a pool which will will produce more blocks and yield a higher payout in the short time that they are mining. This reduces the variance during the time that they do mine, ensuring that hashes are seldom wasted. If these pools reach over 50% of the hashrate they can also offer advantages to miners. For example in the event of a hard fork, the community and developers of a coin may seek to legitimise the longest chain as the the legitimate chain meaning profits are unlikely to be lost in a split. On a number of coins this leads to large monopools. By measuring the percentage hashrate of the largest pools of 18 small GPU-mineable coins the results indicated that on average these coins had a single pool that represented 53% of their hashrate. Figure 4: Shows the % network hashrate of the largest pool on a number of GPU mineable coins as of 01/12/2018 Although these pools are primarily benign, they still pose a threat due to the control they have over the network.

The other, more naive approach is to simply cap reorganisations greater than P blocks. However there are serious problems with this approach, if an attacker can produce a chain of length P +1 and submit it to a different edge of the network as the non attacking chain is being checkpointed, then the network will diverge and will be unable to merge back into a single chain, effectively permanently forking the chain. This attack could, for example, deliberately target an exchange to put the exchange on a fork controlled by the attacker but distinct from the main network until manual maintenance is undertaken by the exchange to re-sync to the proper network chain.

Thus the introduction of checkpoints doesn\u2019t significantly impact the potential consequences of a bug that causes a chain pause. An active double spend on the Loki network is likely to cause more damage to the ecosystem than a temporary chain pause.

The first and second rules can be easily detected by allowing Service Nodes to submit any Service Node\u2019s signature as evidence for a deregistration transaction if the signature conflicts with an existing onchain checkpoint. Rule 3 can be solved by investigating each checkpoint for all Service Node signatures.

Because a super majority of quorum signatures is required to sign a block and the quorum size is 20, the attack would only need to prevent communication of 18 nodes over the course of two consecutive checkpoints to freeze the blockchain. The novel protection for this attack is Service Nodes having the ability to whitelist other nodes inside of their own active quorum when Service Nodes detects an attack. Practically speaking, Service Nodes would turn on this protection automatically when the previous quorum has failed to sign a block.

Monero is an evolution on the CryptoNote protocol , which uses ring signatures , stealth addresses , and RingCT , giving users the ability to sign transactions and obfuscate amounts while maintaining plausible deniability. Ring Signatures \u00b6 Ring signatures work by constructing a ring of possible signers to a transaction where only one of the signers is the actual sender. Loki makes use of ring signatures to obfuscate the true history of transaction outputs. Ring signatures will be mandatory for all Loki transactions (excluding block reward transactions), and uniquely, a fixed ring-size of ten is enforced on the Loki blockchain. This means that each input will spend from one of ten possible outputs, including the true output. Ring Signature Size \u00b6 The size of a ring signature refers to how many mixins are used to construct the ring. Monero currently has an enforced minimum ring signature size of seven, with six mixins used alongside the real unspent output in a transaction. The effect of larger ring-sizes has been sparsely studied, however, in paper 0001 (published by the Monero Research Lab), the effect of differing ring-sizes was analysed versus an attacker who owned a large number of outputs on the blockchain . It was found that higher ring-sizes reduce the timeframe in which a malicious attacker who owned a large number of unspent outputs would be able to perform effective analysis of transactions. Mandating larger ring-sizes also protects against a theoretical attack known as an EABE/Knacc attack , where a third-party (i.e. an exchange) can perform limited temporal analysis on transactions between two users. Additionally, Monero has no maximum ring-size enforced by network consensus rules. Many wallets like the Monero GUI wallet cap the ring-size at 26. However, a user is free to manually create a transaction with whatever ring-size they wish, as long as it is above a ring-size of seven. This is problematic since most wallets have a default ring-size of seven. Increasing a transactions ring-size above seven makes it stand out. Further, if an individuals transactions were to always use a non-standard ring-size in Monero (ten for example), a passive third-party could analyse the blockchain and infer patterns using temporal analysis. transaction hash ring size tx size[kB] 3feaff3f48de0bc4c92ec027236165337b64df404aca098e212c1215e9456697 7 13.47 39d484f7c0a2e8f3823a514056d7cb0bf269171cb4582e05955d4c5ee995cad0 7 13.47 e08f5a937e725011bedd44075334ae98dcca32749da231c56da1278d49c0a231 7 13.50 ab35e69d9cca39219c90df8b2b7aab4a54c82127fb1fbaae65d76357f8f76387 7 13.5 6d8ccd56dc2d3eb7de03ba767f0dbf4d5f42ae91e67f4c28f16d6f8b0229c272 10 13.87 Loki Static Ring Size \u00b6 Loki improves on both of these problems by statically enforcing ring-sizes, and setting the ring-size to ten. Statically setting the maximum ring-size protects users who construct rings with more than nine mixins and setting the ring-size minimum to ten more effectively prevents an attacker who owns a large number of outputs from discerning the true outputs spent in a ring signature. Larger ring-sizes also increase the default churning effectiveness non-linearly, becoming more effective as ring-sizes grow. In the current transaction scheme, increasing the ring-size to 10 would lead to a 2.6% increase in the size of the transaction. However, when Bulletproofs are implemented it will account for about a 8 - 13% increase in the size of a transaction. This is because of the overall reduction in transaction size caused by Bulletproofs. Increasing the minimum ring-size may present a problem on a network that lacks architecture to support larger sized transactions, due to the increased overhead. With Loki however, this burden can be carried by Service Nodes that are incentivised to operate and provide sufficient bandwidth. Stealth Addresses \u00b6 Loki makes use of stealth addresses to ensure that the true public key of the receiver is never linked to their transaction. Every time a Loki transaction is sent, a one-time stealth address is created and the funds are sent to this address. Using a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the receiver of the transaction is able to calculate a private spend key for this stealth address, thereby taking ownership of the funds without having to reveal their true public address. Stealth addresses provide protection to receivers of transactions and are a core privacy feature in Loki. RingCT \u00b6 RingCT was first proposed by the Monero Research Lab as a way to obfuscate transaction amounts. Current deployments of RingCT use range proofs, which leverage Pedersen commitments to prove that the amount of a transaction being sent is between 0 and 2 64 . This range ensures that only non-negative amounts of currency are sent, without revealing the actual amount sent in the transaction. Recently a number of cryptocurrencies have proposed implementing bulletproofs as a replacement to traditional range proofs in RingCT because of the significant reduction in transaction size.

The salient cryptoeconomic problem is how to incentivise actors in the Loki network to operate Service Nodes in a manner compatible with the objectives of the Loki network, in particular decentralisation and privacy. To solve this problem the Loki Project team commissioned two Economic papers: Cryptoeconomics of the Loki Network : This Economic Report was commissioned to characterise the game theory behind incentivising Service Node operators. Loki Cryptoeconomics : This Report was commissioned to apply the game theory specific to the Loki Networks economics. These 2 papers analysed the Block Reward , Block Reward Split , Inflation , Circulating Supply and the amount of potential Service Nodes on the network to develop a cryptoeconomic solution to incentivise Service Node Operators. Block Rewards \u00b6 A block reward is the reward created when a new block has been generated. The reward is distributed to the peers in the network that helped facilitate the generation of the block. In most cases, the miners are the individuals who receive this reward as they collect and write transactions into blocks. Loki Block Reward \u00b6 The Loki Block Reward is generated in a similar manner to most proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. Miners use proof-of-work to generate a block and then a reward is released to the network. The reward is then distributed not only distributed to the Miner but to a Service Node Operator and the Governance pool. The amount of Loki rewarded BR to the network at each block height h follows the following equation: This block reward formula is a result of Loki's Cryptoeconomic study , on the 30th of July, 2018, at block 64324, the Loki block reward went from being calculated in terms of the circulating supply with an emission speed factor of 20, to be derived from the block height. Block Reward Split \u00b6 As Service Node's went live on 20th of September, 2018, at block 101250, the addition of a Block Reward split was required to financially incentivise Service Node Operators to maintain and run Service Nodes. During the fork on the 30th of July, 2018, the Block Reward was hard coded to split the reward as follows: Party Percent of Reward Service Nodes 50% Miners 45% Governance 5% Mining Reward \u00b6 As well as collecting transactions fees, 45% of the block reward is awarded to the miner that constructs the block. Service Node Reward \u00b6 The second output in each block (50% of total reward) goes to a Service Node , or two Service Nodes if a relay is selected. Service Nodes are rewarded based on the time since they last received a reward (or time since they registered), with a preference for nodes that have been waiting longer. Each time a Service Node registers with the network it assumes the last position in the queue. If the Service Node maintains good service and is not ejected from the queue by a swarm flag , it slowly migrates to the higher positions in the queue. Nodes at or near the front of the queue are eligible for a reward, and once awarded, the node again drops to the last position in the queue and begins slowly working its way back up.

network of Service Nodes . The salient cryptoeconomic problem is how to incentivise actors in the Loki network to operate Service Nodes in a manner compatible with the objectives of the Loki network, in particular decentralisation and privacy. To solve this problem the Loki Project team commissioned two Economic papers: Cryptoeconomics of the Loki Network : This Economic Report was commissioned to characterise the game theory behind incentivising Service Node operators. Loki Cryptoeconomics : This Report was commissioned to apply the game theory specific to the Loki Networks economics. These 2 papers analysed the Block Reward , Block Reward Split , Inflation , Circulating Supply and the amount of potential Service Nodes on the network to develop a cryptoeconomic solution to incentivise Service Node Operators.","title":"Cryptoeconomics"},{"location":"Advanced/Cryptoeconomics/#block-rewards","text":"A block reward is the reward created when a new block has been generated.

The amount of Loki rewarded BR to the network at each block height h follows the following equation: This block reward formula is a result of Loki's Cryptoeconomic study , on the 30th of July, 2018, at block 64324, the Loki block reward went from being calculated in terms of the circulating supply with an emission speed factor of 20, to be derived from the block height.","title":"Loki Block Reward"},{"location":"Advanced/Cryptoeconomics/#block-reward-split","text":"As Service Node's went live on 20th of September, 2018, at block 101250, the addition of a Block Reward split was required to financially incentivise Service Node Operators to maintain and run Service Nodes.

Each time a Service Node registers with the network it assumes the last position in the queue. If the Service Node maintains good service and is not ejected from the queue by a swarm flag , it slowly migrates to the higher positions in the queue. Nodes at or near the front of the queue are eligible for a reward, and once awarded, the node again drops to the last position in the queue and begins slowly working its way back up.","title":"Service Node Reward"},{"location":"Advanced/Cryptoeconomics/#governance-reward","text":"The final 5% portion of the block reward is distributed towards governance operations ;","title":"Governance Reward"},{"location":"Advanced/Cryptoeconomics/#inflation","text":"Click to expand data Year BH Circulating supply Inflation 0 0 22500000 77.12% 1 262800 39852116.29 19.79% 2 525600 47738927.03 15.48% 3 788400 55129105.11 13.35% 4 1051200 62489416.22 11.78% 5 1314000 69847931.15 10.53% 6 1576800 77206338.06 9.53% 7 1839600 84564738.47 8.70% 8 2102400 91923138.5 8.00% 9 2365200 99281538.5 7.41% 10 2628000 106639938.5 6.90% 11 2890800 113998338.5 6.45% 12 3153600 121356738.5 6.06% 13 3416400 128715138.5 5.72% 14 3679200 136073538.5 5.41% 15 3942000 143431938.5 5.13%","title":"Inflation"},{"location":"Advanced/Cryptoeconomics/#circulating-supply","text":"The Circulating Supply is the total amount of $Loki in circulation.

For messages, this proof-of-work is calculated as a Blake2b hash of the message. For path creation, the proof-of-work is sent along with the request for a node to be included in the path building process.

Historically, Loki miners have secured the blockchain with Proof of Work (PoW), produced blocks, and organised transactions. However Service Node checkpointing will provide security to the blockchain, diminishing a miner\u2019s role to that of only producing blocks and organising transactions. This naturally raises questions about whether miners can, or should be, removed in favour of a system where Service Nodes directly produce blocks, order transactions and secure the chain. The following Loki Improvement Proposal (LIP) will discuss this idea, with the view that a Proof of Stake (PoS) scheme should be adopted. This LIP will also outline how this could be achieved in Loki with a new PoS scheme called \u201cPulse\u201d. The Case for PoS \u00b6 There are several clear arguments that can be made for the adoption of PoS for Loki which I will elaborate on. Increases the Investment That Is Needed to Attack Loki \u00b6 To double spend a transaction, an attacker needs to produce an alternate blockchain with more cumulative difficulty in secret, which reverses a previously spent transaction. Assuming the malicious miner is not using advanced strategies (selfish mining, cartels), this requires the miner obtain 51% of the hashing power. Using RandomXL, Loki\u2019s current mining algorithm which is optimized for CPU performance, a Ryzen 1700 is able to produce about 4500 hashes per second. The total hashrate for Loki is currently about 17 Megahashes. Let's assume every miner is using a Ryzen 1700. This would equate to about 3,691 Ryzen 1700 chips on the Loki Network. If we estimate the hardware cost (including peripherals) of a malicious attacker, each of these miners could conservatively cost 400$ USD[1]. This means that for 51% of the hashrate to be obtained, an attacker would have to buy about 730,000$ USD worth of hardware to successfully attack the network. Keep in mind this uses very conservative estimates with consumer level pricing. It's likely that an attacker would be able to decrease their cost per unit well below 400$ USD, or the attacker could rent the equivalent hashing power, further reducing the cost of an attack. Compromising Masternode PoS would require that the malicious party or consortium own or rent control over 51% of the staked supply. As of the time of writing,, Loki has 620 staked Service Nodes and each stake is approximately 22,000 Loki. This means the malicious operators would need to gain control of about 13.6 million Loki, and with the current cost of Loki at ~0.15$ USD, this equates to about 2 million USD. This scenario ignores the fact that attempting to obtain such a large amount of Loki from the open market would inevitably lead to an increase in price (as with lower supply, and fixed demand, price increases) which would further inflate the cost. It Presents an Increased Sunken Cost for an Attacker \u00b6 RandomXL is designed to provide increased performance on hardware similar to general purpose CPUs, which means that hardware used in any attack is not a sunk cost as it can be recovered by selling or repurposing hardware used in the attack. In a Proof of Stake system where attackers have to buy into the network, performing an attack is likely to reduce users trust in the security of the network, making users likely to sell coins and devalue the attackers own stake. This makes it harder for the attacker to recoup their costs when selling their stake back to the network. Reduced Environmental Impact \u00b6 Proof of Work by its nature requires thousands of miners compete against each other to solve computationally hard mathematical problems. Many people are concerned about the environmental impact of mining, as it uses a massive amount of electricity. Proof of Stake, as implemented in Pulse does not require these energy intensive calculations: instead, it relies on the cooperation of Loki Service Nodes \u2014 which use comparatively small amounts of electricity. Pulse Overview \u00b6 Every 120 seconds, a leader is chosen from the top of the Service Node list. This leader creates a candidate block which they send to 11 randomly chosen Service Node validators. The validators ensure the block is valid, then perform a group ceremony to create a random value. Once the ceremony is finished, each validator includes the final random value in the candidate block, which they sign and send to their validator peers. Once a candidate block has more than 7 signatures, it can be published to the network as a valid block. The process is then repeated to create the next block. Pulse Specifics \u00b6 Proposal Round \u00b6 A single leader chosen sequentially from the Service Node list, plus a group of 11 validators chosen deterministically from the random value included in the last block. The leader scans the transaction pool and collects valid transactions into a block. With this information, the leader creates a candidate block which contains a coinbase transaction. The leader is rewarded according to the Service Node coinbase formula, and receives any transaction tx fees included in the block. The leader signs this candidate block and sends it to all of the validators, who each send it to 3 others until all validators successfully receive the candidate block. Every validator should now wait {candidate_wait}. Commit Round \u00b6 After waiting {candidate_wait}, every validator now generates a 128 bit integer, and commits to that integer by sending the hash of that integer to all other validators. Validators now wait {commit_wait}. Reveal Round \u00b6 After waiting {commit_wait}, validators may reveal the pre-image of the hash \u2014 which in this case is the random integer they committed to. They then send the pre-image of their committed hash to all validating peers. Validators now wait {reveal_wait}. After waiting {reveal_wait}, all validators should now have a subset of the revealed values, which they can combine locally to produce the final random value. Validators can add this to the candidate block and sign the resultant block. This signature is then sent to all other validators. Block Submission \u00b6 All validators now wait {submit_wait}. Once {submit_wait} has elapsed, validators check the validity of the other validator\u2019s signatures, ensuring they are signing the same candidate block and signing the same final random integer. Once signatures are validated, any validator in the quorum may submit a block to the network which includes at least 7 signatures from the group of validators.

The current logic of sequentially rewarding each Service Node in a sorted list would be preserved, however for a Service Node to win this reward they must act honestly as a leader by producing a valid candidate block. Time Synchronicity \u00b6 We assume that Service Nodes maintain relative synchronicity (within the boundary of the enforced timeouts), which means that when an event like a creation of a new block is triggered, all Service Nodes should react to this event within a reasonable amount of time. Service Nodes \u00b6 We assume that a large and diverse network of staked Service Nodes exist; and that these Service Nodes will act as validators and leaders in the scheme. Because of their significant stake they may be punished by having their stake locked for a period of time (currently 30 days) using a deregistration transaction. Fault Tolerance \u00b6 Failures \u00b6 To make the first implementation of Pulse fairly straightforward, there will only ever be one way in which it can fail: a timeout. Initially this will sacrifice some speed \u2014 especially when recovering offline validators or leaders \u2014 however, this process can be sped up significantly once we have assessed the stability of the protocol in a live environment. Timeouts and Swap Blocks \u00b6 A timeout occurs when a valid block is not produced after max_timeout, which is the sum of all of the wait periods \u2014 effectively 120 seconds. As soon as the leader of the next quorum detects a timeout, they may immediately begin building and distributing a candidate block with a \u201cswap\u201d tag to their validators. If this block is signed by the validators, the swap tag will indicate that there was a quorum failure to newly syncing nodes, and nodes who have been offline. The next leader can always be calculated by XOR\u2019ing the last randomly produced value by a counter which iterates every time a block isn\u2019t created [2]. Demerits and Deregistrations \u00b6 Validators in a quorum can submit intent to demerit messages at any stage for a leader (or any other validator in their quorum) if they feel they have not followed the protocol. For example, if a leader never publishes a candidate block, any validator in the quorum may send an intent to demerit message to their other peers. If this message is signed by the majority of other validators it may be submitted to the network as a demerit point message. This message is not a transaction, and simply propagates through the p2p layer. When obligation quorums are created, each node selected for that obligation quorum checks their local log for demerit points, and if more than a predefined amount of demerit points have been seen in a period of time then a deregistration or decommission transaction with the relevant signed demerit points can be submitted to the network. Common Failure Cases \u00b6 To get a better understanding of Pulse, it is worth discussing what happens in some common failure cases. A leader does not submit a candidate block Not enough validators participate in the commit or reveal rounds Validators sign two different blocks Validators are unable to submit a block due to differences in revealed values Leader Does Not Submit a Candidate Block \u00b6 If a leader fails to construct and send a candidate block, the validators will be triggered to submit an intent to demerit message. If this message is signed by a simple majority of the quorum, a demerit point can be applied to the leader. The next leader will trigger the creation of a new block when max_timeout has elapsed. Not Enough Validators Participate in the Commit or Reveal Rounds \u00b6 Although all Service Nodes are incentivised to cooperate during the commit and reveal phases of the protocol to avoid demerit points, some participants may act maliciously or go offline during the process. The protocol should be able to tolerate the failure of 6 of 11 nodes during the commit reveal stage. As above, any validator that does not participate in a commit or reveal round, or reveals a different value from their commitment, can be flagged by other validators with an intent to demerit message. If this message is signed by a majority of nodes, this message can be submitted to the network as evidence of a node\u2019s non-performance in a block creation quorum. If more than 6 of 11 nodes do not participate in the commit or reveal round, the quorum will not be able to create a block \u2014 which means the next quorum can take over block creation when max_timeout is reached. Validators Are Unable to Submit a Block Due to Differences in Revealed Values \u00b6 There may be a number of cases where not all of the Service Nodes correctly receive all of the committed or revealed values. This will lead to the final random value that a validator calculates not matching the rest of the validators values. As with other errors the scheme will progress normally as long as the revealed values for 7 of the 11 validators match. Nodes with invalid revealed values can query the other validators in their quorum again to receive any values they missed during the two rounds. If more than 7 nodes disagree on the final revealed value, then the scheme will fail after max_timeout and the next leader may begin the process of producing a new block. Validator Signs Two Different Blocks \u00b6 Any Service Node, including a validator or leader, may submit a deregistration transaction if they can produce signatures from any other Service Node that signs multiple blocks which compete for the same height, or signs a competing chain once more than two checkpoints have been applied. This means that any node that signs blocks indiscriminately in block creation quorums will be immediately removed from the network with their funds locked. Traditional PoS Attacks \u00b6 Stake grind attacks \u00b6 Stake grinding usually refers to a class of attacks where a validator or leader can iterate values to bias the selection of the next chosen validator. Since validators are chosen by using a collaboratively generated random integer in each block, it is possible to bias the results of the scheme. However the only way to do this effectively is for a validator to choose not to reveal a value that they previously committed. In the context of Service Node selection for the next quorum, this biasing is extremely weak, and the action of committing but failing to reveal a value leads to a demerit message being submitted for the validator who performs such an action, making this attack infeasible. Long Range Attacks \u00b6 Long range attacks are attacks where nodes that are syncing the chain, or that are offline for a period of time, can be convinced of an alternate state of the chain. This occurs because old Service Nodes can use previously held Service Node keys to resign blocks that appear as alternate chains. Online Nodes \u00b6 The Loki blockchain already provides a solution for online nodes with Service Node checkpointing. This prevents Service Nodes from altering blocks that have received more than 2 checkpoints[3]. However, tackling the problem of nodes that go offline and miss more than two checkpoints in a row or nodes who are syncing for the first time is more difficult. Syncing Nodes or Partially Offline Nodes \u00b6 When a node has no previous state of the blockchain, or has been offline long enough to miss enough checkpoints that it is infeasible for it to validate the non alteration of blocks, it must use an external trusted source to correctly identify the main chain. This is usually referred to as weak subjectivity [4]. The easiest way to solve this issue is to allow syncing Service Nodes, and Service Nodes that have been offline to refer to the seed nodes to ascertain what is the true chain. This is already the case in Proof of Work blockchains, since seed nodes provide the initial list of peers to sync from. To implement weak subjectivity in Loki, seed nodes should additionally provide a list of the latest checkpoints, so that when a client is syncing they can ensure they are syncing to the correct chain \u2014 and not being segmented onto a network with valid but altered signatures. Nothing at Stake \u00b6 The \u2018nothing at stake\u2019 problem references a validator\u2019s tendency to sign or authorise multiple competing blocks in a Proof of Stake system. They are incentivised to do this because they can\u2019t be sure which chain will become the true chain in the long term, thereby they should sign competing blocks to ensure they don't miss rewards. With Pulse, the \u2018nothing at stake\u2019 problem is prevented by allowing nodes in the network to submit evidence of double signed blocks. If this evidence can be validated, the offending node can be deregistered from the network, providing a punishment for nodes who do not effectively choose a single block to sign. DDOS attacks \u00b6 All Service Nodes in the Loki network maintain a public IP address so they are reachable by other Service Nodes and Lokinet/Loki Messenger users. These IP addresses are held in a distributed list that anyone can access. This opens the Service Node network and especially block producing quorums to DDoS attacks. For example, an attacker could wait for a block to be successfully published and immediately identify the members of the next quorum who will produce a block. With this information, they could launch a DDoS attack aimed to interrupt the communication between validators, or between the leader and validators. If successful, they would prevent a new block from being produced and could continue this attack on successive quorums. Although individual Service Nodes have incentives to prevent DDoS attacks (so they can earn rewards and avoid demerit points), there are some protections we can offer in the Loki software suite which can be deployed in the case that the previous block has failed to be produced. The most trivial protection is that after a failure in block creation, Service Nodes in the next selected quorum should ignore any connections from IP addresses which do not belong to another Service Node. This limits the scope of the attacker\u2019s DDoS to only Service Nodes \u2014 which are costly to operate and far less numerous than a botnet-like DDoS attack. Service Node operators could also reasonably rate limit other Service Nodes on a per key basis, choosing not to respond to Service Nodes who put undue strain on their own networks. Considerations \u00b6 Safety of Commit Reveal schemes \u00b6 Collaborative commit reveal schemes for generating random values are well studied, and limitations on such schemes are well known [5][6][7]. The primary downside to using this type of scheme is that although committed values cannot be changed after they have been committed, a contributor to the scheme may bias the results by not revealing their committed value at all. For example, say a block creation quorum produces a value between 0 and 10 each block, and Alice wants to run an online casino which uses this random integer to flip a coin, with bets being placed on heads or tails. Alice\u2019s casino algorithm reads the random integer from the blockchain and if the random value is between 0-4 then the coin is tails, and if it's between 5-10 it\u2019s heads. A possible attack on this application would be for a Service Node operator, let\u2019s call her \u201cMallory\u201d, to wait to become a validator in a quorum, act honestly, and commit to a random value. Once she has committed to the scheme, she waits for the other validators to reveal their original integers. She can now calculate the shared random result for those validators that have revealed. Let\u2019s suppose their combined final value will be 3. Using this information and whatever deterministic algorithm that is used to combine each validators contribution, Mallory can now decide whether or not she wants to reveal her result and add her contribution to this data. If Mallory bets on tails and realises revealing her commitment would change the overall result to heads, then she should not reveal her commitment. If her commitment (when combined with the other commitments) still selects a number under 3, then she can reveal her committed value. Of course, the cost of not revealing a commitment is demerit points being applied to Mallory\u2019s Service Node which will lead to deregistration in the event that Mallory has not revealed her commitments consistently. However, as long as Mallory\u2019s winnings are more than the cost of being deregistered from the Service Node network, her dishonest actions are financially incentivised. It should be clear from this example that Service Nodes can significantly bias the results of decisions which have few available outcomes, like a coin toss. So applications should not use the random integer we are creating for these type of use cases! The Loki blockchain, however, does not use the source of randomness in this way. We use the randomness to choose Service Nodes in a Service Node list, where biasing the results has an insignificant effect as the possible outcomes are far more numerous. With Pulse, the randomness seeds an algorithm that chooses a combination of 11 nodes out of currently about 620 nodes. Mallory, in this case, would be able to choose between two (and only two) different random samples of 11 nodes from the selection of 620, but this single extra choice is highly unlikely to provide a notable benefit in terms of opportunistic selection. Blocktimes \u00b6 In Loki, a block is created on average every 120 seconds, however block production is distributed on an exponential distribution, meaning blocks will often be created earlier or later than expected. This effect is exacerbated during large hashrate fluctuations, and this unpredictability can be frustrating for users waiting for transactions to confirm. Blocktime in Pulse is controlled through mandatory wait periods that are added at each stage of block creation. Conservative estimates have been taken for the first implementation of the proposed scheme, allowing for nodes who maintain relative synchronicity to successfully participate in the scheme. It's likely that after testing we can reduce or eliminate some of these mandatory wait periods thereby reducing the blocktime. However, in the first implementation, we target a predictable block time of 120 seconds \u2014 excluding the rare case where block creation fails. In this case, a block would be created in the subsequent 120 seconds. This means that in a majority of cases users won't be left wondering when the next block is coming, since blocks will be predictability created every 120 seconds. Conclusion \u00b6 Pulse is a robust yet simple scheme which provides a clear vision for the future of block creation and transaction ordering in the Loki Network. Pulse does this while also increasing security and decreasing the need to use energy intensive proof of work. Additionally, it better aligns existing incentive structures to reward those who do the most work to create order, and secure the network.

Historically, Loki miners have secured the blockchain with Proof of Work (PoW), produced blocks, and organised transactions. However Service Node checkpointing will provide security to the blockchain, diminishing a miner\u2019s role to that of only producing blocks and organising transactions. This naturally raises questions about whether miners can, or should be, removed in favour of a system where Service Nodes directly produce blocks, order transactions and secure the chain. The following Loki Improvement Proposal (LIP) will discuss this idea, with the view that a Proof of Stake (PoS) scheme should be adopted. This LIP will also outline how this could be achieved in Loki with a new PoS scheme called \u201cPulse\u201d.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Advanced/PulseLip5/#the-case-for-pos","text":"There are several clear arguments that can be made for the adoption of PoS for Loki which I will elaborate on.","title":"The Case for PoS"},{"location":"Advanced/PulseLip5/#increases-the-investment-that-is-needed-to-attack-loki","text":"To double spend a transaction, an attacker needs to produce an alternate blockchain with more cumulative difficulty in secret, which reverses a previously spent transaction. Assuming the malicious miner is not using advanced strategies (selfish mining, cartels), this requires the miner obtain 51% of the hashing power. Using RandomXL, Loki\u2019s current mining algorithm which is optimized for CPU performance, a Ryzen 1700 is able to produce about 4500 hashes per second. The total hashrate for Loki is currently about 17 Megahashes. Let's assume every miner is using a Ryzen 1700. This would equate to about 3,691 Ryzen 1700 chips on the Loki Network. If we estimate the hardware cost (including peripherals) of a malicious attacker, each of these miners could conservatively cost 400$ USD[1]. This means that for 51% of the hashrate to be obtained, an attacker would have to buy about 730,000$ USD worth of hardware to successfully attack the network. Keep in mind this uses very conservative estimates with consumer level pricing. It's likely that an attacker would be able to decrease their cost per unit well below 400$ USD, or the attacker could rent the equivalent hashing power, further reducing the cost of an attack. Compromising Masternode PoS would require that the malicious party or consortium own or rent control over 51% of the staked supply. As of the time of writing,, Loki has 620 staked Service Nodes and each stake is approximately 22,000 Loki. This means the malicious operators would need to gain control of about 13.6 million Loki, and with the current cost of Loki at ~0.15$ USD, this equates to about 2 million USD. This scenario ignores the fact that attempting to obtain such a large amount of Loki from the open market would inevitably lead to an increase in price (as with lower supply, and fixed demand, price increases) which would further inflate the cost.","title":"Increases the Investment That Is Needed to Attack Loki"},{"location":"Advanced/PulseLip5/#it-presents-an-increased-sunken-cost-for-an-attacker","text":"RandomXL is designed to provide increased performance on hardware similar to general purpose CPUs, which means that hardware used in any attack is not a sunk cost as it can be recovered by selling or repurposing hardware used in the attack.

If successful, they would prevent a new block from being produced and could continue this attack on successive quorums. Although individual Service Nodes have incentives to prevent DDoS attacks (so they can earn rewards and avoid demerit points), there are some protections we can offer in the Loki software suite which can be deployed in the case that the previous block has failed to be produced. The most trivial protection is that after a failure in block creation, Service Nodes in the next selected quorum should ignore any connections from IP addresses which do not belong to another Service Node. This limits the scope of the attacker\u2019s DDoS to only Service Nodes \u2014 which are costly to operate and far less numerous than a botnet-like DDoS attack. Service Node operators could also reasonably rate limit other Service Nodes on a per key basis, choosing not to respond to Service Nodes who put undue strain on their own networks.","title":"DDOS attacks"},{"location":"Advanced/PulseLip5/#considerations","text":"","title":"Considerations"},{"location":"Advanced/PulseLip5/#safety-of-commit-reveal-schemes","text":"Collaborative commit reveal schemes for generating random values are well studied, and limitations on such schemes are well known [5][6][7]. The primary downside to using this type of scheme is that although committed values cannot be changed after they have been committed, a contributor to the scheme may bias the results by not revealing their committed value at all. For example, say a block creation quorum produces a value between 0 and 10 each block, and Alice wants to run an online casino which uses this random integer to flip a coin, with bets being placed on heads or tails. Alice\u2019s casino algorithm reads the random integer from the blockchain and if the random value is between 0-4 then the coin is tails, and if it's between 5-10 it\u2019s heads. A possible attack on this application would be for a Service Node operator, let\u2019s call her \u201cMallory\u201d, to wait to become a validator in a quorum, act honestly, and commit to a random value. Once she has committed to the scheme, she waits for the other validators to reveal their original integers. She can now calculate the shared random result for those validators that have revealed. Let\u2019s suppose their combined final value will be 3. Using this information and whatever deterministic algorithm that is used to combine each validators contribution, Mallory can now decide whether or not she wants to reveal her result and add her contribution to this data. If Mallory bets on tails and realises revealing her commitment would change the overall result to heads, then she should not reveal her commitment. If her commitment (when combined with the other commitments) still selects a number under 3, then she can reveal her committed value. Of course, the cost of not revealing a commitment is demerit points being applied to Mallory\u2019s Service Node which will lead to deregistration in the event that Mallory has not revealed her commitments consistently. However, as long as Mallory\u2019s winnings are more than the cost of being deregistered from the Service Node network, her dishonest actions are financially incentivised. It should be clear from this example that Service Nodes can significantly bias the results of decisions which have few available outcomes, like a coin toss. So applications should not use the random integer we are creating for these type of use cases! The Loki blockchain, however, does not use the source of randomness in this way. We use the randomness to choose Service Nodes in a Service Node list, where biasing the results has an insignificant effect as the possible outcomes are far more numerous. With Pulse, the randomness seeds an algorithm that chooses a combination of 11 nodes out of currently about 620 nodes. Mallory, in this case, would be able to choose between two (and only two) different random samples of 11 nodes from the selection of 620, but this single extra choice is highly unlikely to provide a notable benefit in terms of opportunistic selection.","title":"Safety of Commit Reveal schemes"},{"location":"Advanced/PulseLip5/#blocktimes","text":"In Loki, a block is created on average every 120 seconds, however block production is distributed on an exponential distribution, meaning blocks will often be created earlier or later than expected. This effect is exacerbated during large hashrate fluctuations, and this unpredictability can be frustrating for users waiting for transactions to confirm. Blocktime in Pulse is controlled through mandatory wait periods that are added at each stage of block creation. Conservative estimates have been taken for the first implementation of the proposed scheme, allowing for nodes who maintain relative synchronicity to successfully participate in the scheme. It's likely that after testing we can reduce or eliminate some of these mandatory wait periods thereby reducing the blocktime. However, in the first implementation, we target a predictable block time of 120 seconds \u2014 excluding the rare case where block creation fails. In this case, a block would be created in the subsequent 120 seconds.

Although Service Nodes in Loki must hold the correct collateral requirement , they may choose to not route traffic or store data in their memory pools. Because this option is financially beneficial (using less bandwidth/CPU cycles/storage), a system of distributed flagging must be proposed to remove underperforming nodes. For Loki, such distributed flagging faces major implementation issues. Fundamentally, every Service Nodes is financially incentivised to flag every other Service Node as a bad actor. This is because when a Service Node is flagged it will face removal from the staking pool and thereby increase the flaggers chance at winning a reward. One potential method of distributed flagging is one in which evidence is provided when a flagging event occurs, however, this solution falls prey to nodes fabricating evidence in their favour. Conversely, flagging without restrictions allows either single nodes or groups of collaborating nodes to intentionally flag honest nodes in order to improve their chances of winning block rewards . To circumvent these issues, Loki proposes swarm flagging. Swarm flagging works by using existing swarms to choose members that will participate in each testing round. Each Service Node holds a copy of the blockchain, and each block created by a miner will deterministically select a number of test swarms. Every block, 1% of the networks swarms are selected for participation in a testing swarm. To calculate participating swarms, the hash of the five previous blocks is used to seed a Mersenne Twister function which then selects swarms by order of their position in the deterministic list. When a swarm has been selected to participate, each node in that swarm is expected to conduct a number of tests on every other node in the swarm. These are not active tests; rather each node stores historical information about its interactions with every other nodenwithin its swarm. Information about bandwidth, message storage , blockchain requests, and exit node functionality are collected and retained over time. New swarm entrants that have yet to gather this information can query Service Nodes outside of their immediate swarm so as to gather data on each of the Service Nodes they test. Each Service Nodes decides how to vote on each of the other swarm members. Once it has made its decision based on the aforementioned tests, it collects and broadcasts its votes to the swarm. Each node in the swarm can now check the votes for all members. If any single node in the swarm has over 50% of the nodes voting against it, any swarm member has the required information to construct a deregistration transaction. Once this transaction is validated and included in a block, all Service Nodes update their DHT, purging any nodes that were voted off. Testing Suite \u00b6 In order to allow the network to self-enforce performance standards, Service Nodes must be equipped with the required tools so as to test other Service Nodes. These tests should cover the scope of all functionality provided by Service Nodes to prevent lazy masternode attacks . In this initial design, four fundamental tests are proposed. Further tests may be added to the test suite as the function of Services Nodes expands. When an operator first runs the Service Nodes software, an empty file with a predetermined size is allocated on disk to ensure that space is present for tasks that require storage. Next, a simple bandwidth test is conducted between the Service Node and a geographically distributed set of testing servers run by the Loki Foundation . These checks are optional, and Service Nodes are allowed to skip, ignore or fail them, and join the pool of untrusted Service Nodes. However, running and passing these tests provides a good indicator to any would-be Service Node operator as to whether they should risk locking collateral in a node that may not meet minimum requirements. Once a Service Node joins the untrusted Service Node pool, their collateral is locked and they are tested by the next chosen swarm. Swarm tests are enforced via consensus and new entrants to the Service Node network cannot evade these tests. If a node passes all swarm tests, they are awarded the trusted node flag and can begin routing packets. Failing this, they are removed from the network and their collateral remains locked for 30 days. Bandwidth Test \u00b6 The bandwidth test forms the backbone of the Loki network test suite. If a node passes this test then it is assumed to be honestly routing packets above the minimum threshold. Each time a node interacts with another Service Node, it will make and retain a record of the incoming bandwidth provided. Over time, nodes will be included in thousands of paths and route millions of messages . These interactions will form the basis of each nodes bandwidth tables. From this table, a node can respond to bandwidth tests about Service Nodes inside its swarm. All nodes are also expected to respond to queries of their own bandwidth tables from other nodes. This means that even nodes who have recently joined the network can query the wider network for information about any specific node in their swarm. Message Storage Test \u00b6 Message storage is essential for offline messaging functionality for users of Loki Messenger . Service Nodes must be tested for their ability to cache messages and serve them to users over the course of the message\u2019s Time-to-live (TTL). Users sending offline messages randomly select a Service Node within the destination users swarm. This node must distribute a copy of the message amongst the rest of the swarm. Depending on the proof-of-work attached to the header of the message, Service Nodes that receive a copy will store the data for the TTL. As the TTL on the original message reaches finality, the distributing node sends a nonce to all other members of the swarm. The swarm uses the nonce adding it to the message then hashing the result and then finally sending it back to the distributing node. This test ensures that Service Nodes hold messages until TTL finality, and face eviction if they are unable to produce the correct message digest. As the sampling of the distributing node is random, over time each Service Node will be able to collect performance data on their swarm peers. Blockchain Storage Test \u00b6 Service Nodes are expected to hold a full copy of the Loki blockchain. By holding a full copy of the blockchain, Service Nodes can perform a number of tasks that are essential to users of the network including acting as a remote node , validating transactions, and locking transactions in Blink . As honest nodes also hold a copy of the blockchain, a dishonest node could avoid holding a full copy by simply requesting blocks from an honest node when tested. To avoid this outcome, the blockchain storage test is designed so that honest nodes that hold a copy of the blockchain can pass this test, while dishonest nodes cannot. To achieve this, the testing node requests each tested node to make a selection of K random transactions within the history of the blockchain which are then concatenated and hashed. This hash is then returned to the testing node. By measuring the latency of this request, the testing node can compare the latency with the expected return time T . The exact value for T will be set to accurately differentiate expected latency between loading from disk and downloading blocks from the network. For any attacker, it should be infeasible to download and hash K blocks within T , and thus piggybacking attacks become difficult. Exit Node Test \u00b6 Service Nodes that opt to act as exit nodes receive additional rewards, and so functional tests are required to ensure this extra reward is not abused. For functional exit testing to occur, a Service Node must be able to emulate the natural search behaviour of a human. If a Service Node can detect that it is being tested, it can respond only to tests and discard legitimate user requests. Emulating natural page request behaviour is difficult, however, exit tests can be designed in such a way so as to make the overhead of sorting between legitimate requests and tests sufficiently difficult so that the difference in bandwidth cost between running a legitimate node and a malicious node is negligible. Service Nodes use a list of search engines, held locally, combined with a dictionary so as to construct pseudorandom natural search terms. The search terms are then fed into the search engines and web pages are randomly chosen from the results. The Service node can now build a path with random nodes acting as relays and the node being tested as the exit node. From this exit, the Service Node requests the webpage result generated from its pseudorandom search. If the result returned by the exit node matches the result as generated by the Service Node, then the exit node is deemed to have passed the test.","title":"Swarm Flagging"},{"location":"Advanced/SwarmFlagging/#swarm-flagging","text":"When nodes operate in a trustless environment without a centralised leader enforcing over arching rules, maintaining proper node behaviour on the network becomes difficult.

We defined a successful Sybil attack as one where a single actor controls over 30% of the network\u2019s nodes. At this level of dominance, an actor could conduct effective network wide temporal analysis. Forcing nodes to have a stake in the network greatly increases the cost of performing a Sybil attack. Towler proved the effectiveness of this protection in his game theory model . However, this protection is not guaranteed. Brendan Towler's Game Theoretical Model \u00b6 Using game theory, we were able to model the behaviour of rational economic actors, and built a picture of what the net state of all Service Nodes at any given time should be, given a set of economic conditions. Using this, we were able to assess the potential difficulty and cost of executing a successful Sybil attack on the network under varying conditions. In an economic scenario where only 5% of the circulating supply is locked up in Service Nodes, an attacker would only have to purchase 2.15% of the circulating supply in order to begin conducting effective temporal analysis on the network. Although this attack would be costly, the attacker would be unlikely to experience any compounding effect of the attack cost as a result of their attack. True Market-based Sybil resistance \u00b6 True market-based Sybil resistance only starts to materialise when a greater percentage of the circulating supply is locked up in Service Nodes. In a scenario where 90% of the circulating supply is locked, actors would struggle to purchase enough Loki to perform an effective temporal analysis. However, a 90% lockup is unlikely to occur as Loki aimed to set its equilibrium Service Node lock up to 50% of the circulating supply. In this scenario, an attacker would have to purchase ~21.5% of the circulating supply to begin performing serious network wide temporal analysis. Purchasing ~21.5% of the circulating supply to accomplish this level of saturation will cause liquidity to rapidly decline in the markets, driving up the price of each coin as the accumulation continues. Thus, we would see a compounding effect on the cost of such an attack. Of course, this accumulation can happen over time; depending on the patience of the attacker. Assuming they stake the Loki as they accumulate it, this would dilute the rewards that all Service Nodes receive , including the attacker\u2019s. Towler\u2019s game theoretic model showed that this would start to cause other Service Nodes to drop off the network, but it would also come at an enormous opportunity cost to the attacker. They would suffer a negative Return of Investment (ROI) in dollar terms for all of their nodes as long as the node count remains above the natural equilibrium point derived from a positive $ROI. The Cost of a Sybil Attack on Loki \u00b6 The cost of this Sybil attack is based on the market price and liquidity of Loki over the course of the attack, but assuming low estimates of Loki\u2019s price, this attack would easily run into the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. If an attacker could sustain these costs, they would eventually achieve dominance over the Service Node network and hold at least 30% of the nodes on the network. Other actors would be forced out, depending on their profitability tolerance, and the attacker could potentially start to return a net positive income from this attack. What happens next would then depend on the intentions of the attacker. If the attacker chose to use their dominance to passively perform analysis on the network, the users of Loki may have not noticed that an attack is occurring until follow-on effects of that analysis arise, at which point the value of the network is likely to decline, further hurting the attacker financially. If the attacker where to start using their dominance to undermine the network entirely by manipulating swarm tests , they could initiate the complete collapse of the Service Node network. This would likely have a catastrophic effect on the value of Loki as Service Nodes leave the network and operators attempt to sell their coins. While the network would have been destroyed, the attacker would now own a very large amount of worthless assets - a cost they cannot recover. High Lockup Ratio \u00b6 Through this analysis we can see that the level of Sybil resistance is derived from the attack cost, which is not only affected by the price of Loki, but also by the fact that a higher lockup ratio of the circulating supply has a compounding effect on the cost. Thus, we surmised that having an economic condition where a large percentage of the circulating supply becomes locked is desirable for the Loki Network\u2019s Sybil resistance to remain effective. Although the lockup selection is somewhat arbitrary, for the purposes of modelling, Loki placed this percentage target at 50%. Effective Dollar Return on Capital Input ($ROI) \u00b6 A high lockup ratio (LR) is achieved when the dollar term return on capital input ($ROI) had attracted enough Service Nodes to operate in favour of other forms of investment. The LR was taken to be the midpoint in an equilibrium, where the number of nodes joining the network drove the rate of return down to the lowest tolerable $ROI compared to other forms of investment, and conversely, nodes leaving the network increased the $ROI for the remaining nodes up to the lowest tolerable $ROI. $ROI is calculated by a combination of the following: the dollar value of the Loki required to purchase the staking requirement ($SR) the expected return on that in terms of Loki (LROI)(as the block reward grants the operator Loki, not dollars) the real-world operating cost of running the Service Node (Operating Expenses, $OE) the dollar value of the LROI. From these variables we deduced the actual $ROI. The exact mathematics are discussed extensively in Towler\u2019s Paper: Cryptoeconomics of The Loki Network . The LROI is directly proportional to the number of Service Nodes operating on the network, and the emission curve (the defined Loki inflation rate) embedded into the software. With the emission curve being the one variable we could hard-code, we ensured that it suited the remaining economic conditions we considered desirable. Operating Expenses ($OE) \u00b6 The introduction of the $OE presented a new problem. The cost of operating the Service Node can only be reflected in dollar terms, the dollar return rate of a Service Node directly affected the viability of the investment. The staking requirement must be set high enough so that the $OE are reasonably negligible compared to the $ROI. That being said, it is also important for the scalability of the network that as many Service Nodes as possible are incentivised to operate within this model, which means the staking requirement had to be set at an amount that balances $ROI and the node count (#N). Max Node Count \u00b6 The relationship between staking requirement (SR) and the circulating supply (A) causes a hard limit on #N(Z). For example: If the circulating supply is 50,000,000 and the staking requirement is 50,000, only 1000 nodes can possibly operate. In reality, #N will be the circulating supply divided by the LR, which if we assume our target of 50%, would mean 500 nodes should operate in the right economic conditions. Desirable Economic Properties \u00b6 To design the economic conditions to target a high LR, the $ROI needed to be consistently attractive overtime to raise the LR to our target of 50% or higher. Considering opportunity cost, rational actors would only deploy a Service Node if the $ROI exceeds that of other forms of investment. Using the long running average of stock market performance, we assumed that an 8% per annum $ROI would be near to the lowest tolerable $ROI for rational actors. Of course, this is difficult to define accurately, as the price of Loki is likely to fluctuate, making any long-term assessment of this profitability near impossible without speculating. However, something we could redefine was the emission curve, which directly influences LROI through time. LROI will be proportional to the LR, but as the same amount of Loki will be rewarded each block regardless of the LR, it is one variable we could analyse closely. In summary, we aimed to design the emission curve so that at a target LR of 50%, the rate of return did not fall below 8% $ROI for as long as possible to allow for a market-based Sybil Resistance.","title":"Sybil Resistance"},{"location":"Advanced/SybilResistance/#sybil-resistance","text":"One of the most important features of the Loki network is its built-in market-based Sybil resistance.

Other actors would be forced out, depending on their profitability tolerance, and the attacker could potentially start to return a net positive income from this attack. What happens next would then depend on the intentions of the attacker. If the attacker chose to use their dominance to passively perform analysis on the network, the users of Loki may have not noticed that an attack is occurring until follow-on effects of that analysis arise, at which point the value of the network is likely to decline, further hurting the attacker financially. If the attacker where to start using their dominance to undermine the network entirely by manipulating swarm tests , they could initiate the complete collapse of the Service Node network. This would likely have a catastrophic effect on the value of Loki as Service Nodes leave the network and operators attempt to sell their coins. While the network would have been destroyed, the attacker would now own a very large amount of worthless assets - a cost they cannot recover.","title":"The Cost of a Sybil Attack on Loki"},{"location":"Advanced/SybilResistance/#high-lockup-ratio","text":"Through this analysis we can see that the level of Sybil resistance is derived from the attack cost, which is not only affected by the price of Loki, but also by the fact that a higher lockup ratio of the circulating supply has a compounding effect on the cost. Thus, we surmised that having an economic condition where a large percentage of the circulating supply becomes locked is desirable for the Loki Network\u2019s Sybil resistance to remain effective. Although the lockup selection is somewhat arbitrary, for the purposes of modelling, Loki placed this percentage target at 50%.","title":"High Lockup Ratio"},{"location":"Advanced/SybilResistance/#effective-dollar-return-on-capital-input-roi","text":"A high lockup ratio (LR) is achieved when the dollar term return on capital input ($ROI) had attracted enough Service Nodes to operate in favour of other forms of investment. The LR was taken to be the midpoint in an equilibrium, where the number of nodes joining the network drove the rate of return down to the lowest tolerable $ROI compared to other forms of investment, and conversely, nodes leaving the network increased the $ROI for the remaining nodes up to the lowest tolerable $ROI. $ROI is calculated by a combination of the following: the dollar value of the Loki required to purchase the staking requirement ($SR) the expected return on that in terms of Loki (LROI)(as the block reward grants the operator Loki, not dollars) the real-world operating cost of running the Service Node (Operating Expenses, $OE) the dollar value of the LROI. From these variables we deduced the actual $ROI. The exact mathematics are discussed extensively in Towler\u2019s Paper: Cryptoeconomics of The Loki Network . The LROI is directly proportional to the number of Service Nodes operating on the network, and the emission curve (the defined Loki inflation rate) embedded into the software. With the emission curve being the one variable we could hard-code, we ensured that it suited the remaining economic conditions we considered desirable.","title":"Effective Dollar Return on Capital Input ($ROI)"},{"location":"Advanced/SybilResistance/#operating-expenses-oe","text":"The introduction of the $OE presented a new problem. The cost of operating the Service Node can only be reflected in dollar terms, the dollar return rate of a Service Node directly affected the viability of the investment. The staking requirement must be set high enough so that the $OE are reasonably negligible compared to the $ROI. That being said, it is also important for the scalability of the network that as many Service Nodes as possible are incentivised to operate within this model, which means the staking requirement had to be set at an amount that balances $ROI and the node count (#N).","title":"Operating Expenses ($OE)"},{"location":"Advanced/SybilResistance/#max-node-count","text":"The relationship between staking requirement (SR) and the circulating supply (A) causes a hard limit on #N(Z). For example: If the circulating supply is 50,000,000 and the staking requirement is 50,000, only 1000 nodes can possibly operate. In reality, #N will be the circulating supply divided by the LR, which if we assume our target of 50%, would mean 500 nodes should operate in the right economic conditions.","title":"Max Node Count"},{"location":"Advanced/SybilResistance/#desirable-economic-properties","text":"To design the economic conditions to target a high LR, the $ROI needed to be consistently attractive overtime to raise the LR to our target of 50% or higher. Considering opportunity cost, rational actors would only deploy a Service Node if the $ROI exceeds that of other forms of investment. Using the long running average of stock market performance, we assumed that an 8% per annum $ROI would be near to the lowest tolerable $ROI for rational actors. Of course, this is difficult to define accurately, as the price of Loki is likely to fluctuate, making any long-term assessment of this profitability near impossible without speculating. However, something we could redefine was the emission curve, which directly influences LROI through time. LROI will be proportional to the LR, but as the same amount of Loki will be rewarded each block regardless of the LR, it is one variable we could analyse closely. In summary, we aimed to design the emission curve so that at a target LR of 50%, the rate of return did not fall below 8% $ROI for as long as possible to allow for a market-based Sybil Resistance.","title":"Desirable Economic Properties"},{"location":"Advanced/TechnicalSpecs/","text":"Loki Parameters \u00b6 Item Details Loki Difficulty Target (Block Generation Time) 120 Seconds Difficulty Algorithm ZAWY LWMA Hashing algorithm RandomXL Elliptic Curve Curve25519","title":"Technical Specs"},{"location":"Advanced/TechnicalSpecs/#loki-parameters","text":"Item Details Loki Difficulty Target (Block Generation Time) 120 Seconds Difficulty Algorithm ZAWY LWMA Hashing algorithm RandomXL Elliptic Curve Curve25519","title":"Loki Parameters"},{"location":"Advanced/UsingLokinet/","text":"Using LokiNET \u00b6 // TODO: overview for lokinet cli guide --no-igd on the command line or no-igd=1 in lokid.conf to disable IGD (UPnP port forwarding negotiation). --p2p-bind-ifname=lokitun0 to bind to just the lokinet tun interface // TODO: note which version of lokid has --p2p-bind-ifname option Example command line to start lokid for JUST lokinet traffic lokid --no-igd --p2p-bind-ifname=lokitun0","title":"Using LokiNET"},{"location":"Advanced/UsingLokinet/#using-lokinet","text":"// TODO: overview for lokinet cli guide --no-igd on the command line or no-igd=1 in lokid.conf to disable IGD (UPnP port forwarding negotiation). --p2p-bind-ifname=lokitun0 to bind to just the lokinet tun interface // TODO: note which version of lokid has --p2p-bind-ifname option Example command line to start lokid for JUST lokinet traffic lokid --no-igd --p2p-bind-ifname=lokitun0","title":"Using LokiNET"},{"location":"Advanced/UsingTor/","text":"Using Tor \u00b6 While Loki isn't made to integrate with Tor, it can be used wrapped with torsocks, by setting the following configuration parameters and environment variables: --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 on the command line or p2p-bind-ip=127.0.0.1 in lokid.conf to disable listening for connections on external interfaces. --no-igd on the command line or no-igd=1 in lokid.conf to disable IGD (UPnP port forwarding negotiation), which is pointless with Tor.

It downloads and validates the blockchain from the p2p network. Not aware of your private keys \u00b6 lokid is entirely decoupled from your wallet. lokid does not access your private keys - it is not aware of your transactions and balance. This allows you to run lokid on a separate computer or in the cloud. In fact, you can connect to a remote lokid instance provided by a semi-trusted 3rd party. Such 3rd party will not be able to steal your funds. This is very handy for learning and experimentation. However, there are privacy and reliability implications to using a remote, untrusted node. For any real business you should be running your own full node . Syntax \u00b6 ./lokid [options] [command] Options define how the daemon should be working. Their names follow the --option-name pattern. Commands give access to specific services provided by the daemon. Commands are executed against the running daemon. Their names follow the command_name pattern. Running \u00b6 Go to directory where you unpacked Loki. The stagenet is what your should be using for learning and experimentation. ./lokid --stagenet --detach # run as a daemon in background tail -f ~/.loki/stagenet/loki.log # watch the logs ./lokid --stagenet exit # ask daemon to exit gracefully The mainnnet is when you want to deal with the real $LOKI. ./lokid --detach # run as a daemon in background tail -f ~/.loki/loki.log # watch the logs ./lokid exit # ask daemon to exit gracefully Options \u00b6 Options define how the daemon should be working. Their names follow the --option-name pattern. The following groups are only to make reference easier to follow. The daemon itself does not group options in any way. Help and version \u00b6 Option Description --help Enlist available options. --version Show lokid version to stdout. Example: Loki 'Festive Freya' (v2.0.2-68397db6) --os-version Show build timestamp and target operating system. Example output: OS: Linux #46-Ubuntu SMP Thu Dec 6 14:45:28 UTC 2018 4.15.0-43-generic . Pick network \u00b6 Option Description (missing) By default lokid assumes mainnet --stagenet Run on stagenet. Remember to run your wallet with --stagenet as well. --testnet Run on testnet. Remember to run your wallet with --testnet as well. Logging \u00b6 Option Description --log-file Full path to the log file. Example (mind file permissions): ./lokid --log-file=/var/log/loki/mainnet/lokid.log --log-level 0-4 with 0 being minimal logging and 4 being full tracing. Defaults to 0 . These are general presets and do not directly map to severity levels. For example, even with minimal 0 , you may see some most important INFO entries. Temporarily changing to 1 allows for much better understanding of how the full node operates. Example: ./lokid --log-level=1 --max-log-file-size Soft limit in bytes for the log file (=104850000 by default, which is just under 100MB). Once log file grows past that limit, lokid creates the next log file with a UTC timestamp postfix -YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS . In production deployments, you would probably prefer to use established solutions like logrotate instead. In that case, set --max-log-file-size=0 to prevent lokid from managing the log files. --max-log-files Limit on the number of log files (=50 by default). The oldest log files are removed. In production deployments, you would probably prefer to use established solutions like logrotate instead. Server \u00b6 lokid defaults are adjusted for running it occasionally on the same computer as your Loki wallet. The following options will be helpful if you intend to have an always running node \u2014 most likely on a remote server or your own separate PC. Option Description --config-file Full path to the configuration file. By default loki looks for loki.conf in Loki data directory. --data-dir Full path to data directory. This is where the blockchain, log files, and p2p network memory are stored. For defaults and details see data directory. --pidfile Full path to the PID file. Works only with --detach . Example: ./lokid --detach --pidfile=/run/loki/lokid.pid --detach Go to background (decouple from the terminal). This is useful for long-running / server scenarios. Typically, you will also want to manage lokid daemon with systemd or similar. By default lokid runs in a foreground. --non-interactive Do not require tty in a foreground mode. Helpful when running in a container. By default lokid runs in a foreground and opens stdin for reading. This breaks containerization because no tty gets assigned and lokid process crashes. You can make it run in a background with --detach but this is inconvenient in a containerized environment because the canonical usage is that the container waits on the main process to exist (forking makes things more complicated). --no-igd Disable UPnP port mapping on the router (\"Internet Gateway Device\"). Add this option to improve security if you are not behind a NAT (you can bind directly to public IP or you run through Tor). --max-txpool-weight Set maximum transactions pool size in bytes. By default 648000000 (~618MB). These are transactions pending for confirmations (not included in any block). P2P network \u00b6 The following options define how your node participates in Loki peer-to-peer network. This is for node-to-node communication. The following options do not affect wallet-to-node interface. The node and peer words are used interchangeably. Option Description --p2p-bind-ip Network interface to bind to for p2p network protocol. Default value 0.0.0.0 binds to all network interfaces. This is typically what you want. You must change this if you want to constrain binding, for example to configure connection through Tor via torsocks: DNS_PUBLIC=tcp://1.1.1.1 TORSOCKS_ALLOW_INBOUND=1 torsocks ./lokid --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1\u200a--no-igd\u200a--hide-my-port --p2p-bind-port TCP port to listen for p2p network connections. Defaults to 22022 for mainnet, 38156 for testnet, and 38153 for stagenet. You normally wouldn't change that. This is helpful to run several nodes on your machine to simulate private Loki p2p network (likely using private Testnet). Example: ./lokid --p2p-bind-port=48080 --p2p-bind-port-ipv6 TCP port to listen for p2p network connections. Defaults to 22022 for mainnet, 38156 for testnet, and 38153 for stagenet. --p2p-bind-ipv6-address Interface for p2p network protocol. --p2p-use-ipv6 Enable IPv6 for p2p. --p2p-external-port TCP port to listen for p2p network connections on your router. Relevant if you are behind a NAT and still want to accept incoming connections. You must then set this to relevant port on your router. This is to let lokid know what to advertise on the network. Default is 0 . --hide-my-port lokid will still open and listen on the p2p port. However, it will not announce itself as a peer list candidate. Technically, it will return port 0 in a response to p2p handshake ( node_data.my_port = 0 in get_local_node_data function). In effect nodes you connect to won't spread your IP to other nodes. To sum up, it is not really hiding, it is more like \"do not advertise\". --seed-node Connect to a node to retrieve other nodes' addresses, and disconnect. If not specified, lokid will use hardcoded seed nodes on the first run, and peers cached on disk on subsequent runs. --add-peer Manually add node to local peer list. --add-priority-node Specify list of nodes to connect to and then attempt to keep the connection open. To add multiple nodes use the option several times. Example: ./lokid --add-priority-node=178.128.192.138:18081 --add-priority-node=144.76.202.167:18081 --add-exclusive-node Specify list of nodes to connect to only. If this option is given the options --add-priority-node and --seed-node are ignored. To add multiple nodes use the option several times. Example: ./lokid --add-exclusive-node=178.128.192.138:18081 --add-exclusive-node=144.76.202.167:18081 --out-peers Set max number of outgoing connections to other nodes. By default 8. Value -1 represents the code default. --in-peers Set max number of incoming connections (nodes actively connecting to you). By default unlimited. Value -1 represents the code default. --limit-rate-up Set outgoing data transfer limit [kB/s]. By default 2048 kB/s. Value -1 represents the code default. --limit-rate-down Set incoming data transfer limit [kB/s]. By default 8192 kB/s. Value -1 represents the code default. --limit-rate Set the same limit value for incoming and outgoing data transfer. By default ( -1 ) the individual up/down default limits will be used. It is better to use --limit-rate-up and --limit-rate-down instead to avoid confusion. --offline Do not listen for peers, nor connect to any. Useful for working with a local, archival blockchain. --allow-local-ip Allow adding local IP to peer list. Useful mostly for debug purposes when you may want to have multiple nodes on a single machine. --service-node Generate a Service Node pubkey that identifies your Node to the network. This flag allows the ability to stake Loki Node RPC API \u00b6 lokid node offers powerful API. It serves 3 purposes: provides network data (stats, blocks, transactions, ...) provides local node information (peer list, hash rate if mining, ...) provides interface for wallets (send transactions, ...) This API is typically referred to as \"RPC\" because it is mostly based on JSON/RPC standard. The following options define how the API behaves. Option Description --rpc-bind-ip IP to listen on. By default 127.0.0.1 because API gives full administrative capabilities over the node. Set it to 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces - but only in connection with one of *-restricted-* options and --confirm-external-bind . --rpc-bind-port TCP port to listen on. By default 22023 (mainnet), 38157 (testnet), 38154 (stagenet). --rpc-restricted-bind-port TCP port to listen on with the limited version of API. The limited API can be made public to create an Open Node. At the same time, you may firewall the full API port to still enjoy local querying and administration. --confirm-external-bind Confirm you consciously set --rpc-bind-ip to non-localhost IP and you understand the consequences. --restricted-rpc Restrict API to view only commands and do not return privacy sensitive data. Note this does not make sense with --rpc-restricted-bind-port because you would end up with two restricted APIs. --rpc-login Specify username[:password] required to connect to API. Practical usage seems limited because API communication is in plain text over HTTP. --rpc-access-control-origins Specify a comma separated list of origins to allow cross origin resource sharing. This is useful if you want to use lokid API directly from a web browser via JavaScript (say in a pure-fronted web appp scenario). With this option lokid will put proper HTTP CORS headers to its responses. You will also need to set --rpc-login if you use this option. Normally though, the API is used by backend app and this option isn't necessary. --rpc-bind-ipv6-address Specify IPv6 address to bind RPC server --rpc-use-ipv6 Allow IPv6 for RPC Accepting Loki \u00b6 Option Description --block-notify Run a program for each new block. The argument must be a full path . If the argument contains %s it will be replaced by the block hash. Example: ./lokid --block-notify=\"/usr/bin/echo %s\" Couple of notes: 1) Block notifications are good for immediate reaction. However, you should always assume you will miss some block notifications and you should independently poll the API to cover this up. 2) Mind blockchain reorganizations. Block notifications can revert to same and past heights. This actually happens pretty often. 3) See also --tx-notify option of loki-wallet-rpc daemon here . Performance \u00b6 These are advanced options that allow you to optimize performance of your lokid node, sometimes at the expense of reliability. Option Description --db-sync-mode Specify sync option, using format: [safe|fast|fastest]:[sync|async]:[<nblocks_per_sync>[blocks]|<nbytes_per_sync>[bytes]] The default is fast:async:250000000bytes . The fast:async:* can corrupt blockchain database in case of a system crash. It should not corrupt if just lokid crashes. If you are concerned with system crashes use safe:sync . --max-concurrency Max number of threads to use for a parallel jobs. The default value 0 uses the number of CPU threads. --prep-blocks-threads Max number of threads to use when computing block hashes (PoW) in groups. Defaults to 4. Decrease this if you don't want lokid hog your computer when syncing. --fast-block-sync Sync up most of the way by using embedded, \"known\" block hashes. Pass 1 to turn on and 0 to turn off. This is on ( 1 ) by default. Normally, for every block the full node must calculate the block hash to verify miner's proof of work. Because the CryptoNight PoW used in Loki is very expensive (even for verification), lokid offers skipping these calculations for old blocks. In other words, it's a mechanism to trust lokid binary regarding old blocks' PoW validity, to sync up faster. --block-sync-size How many blocks are processed in a single batch during chain synchronization. By default this is 20 blocks for newer history and 100 blocks for older history (\"pre v4\"). Default behavior is represented by value 0 . Intuitively, the more resources you have, the bigger batch size you may want to try out. Example: ./lokid --block-sync-size=500 --bootstrap-daemon-address The host:port of a \"bootstrap\" remote open node that the connected wallets can use while this node is still not fully synced. Example: ./lokid --bootstrap-daemon-address=opennode.xmr-tw.org:18089 . The node will forward selected RPC calls to the bootstrap node. The wallet will handle this automatically and transparently. Obviously, such bootstraping phase has privacy implications similar to directly using a remote node. --bootstrap-daemon-login Specify username:password for the bootstrap daemon login (if required). This considers the RPC interface used by the wallet. Normally, open nodes do not require any credentials. Mining \u00b6 The following options configure solo mining using CPU with the standard software stack lokid . This is mostly useful for: generating your stagenet or testnet coins experimentation and learning if you have super cheap access to vast CPU resources Be advised though that real mining happens in pools and with high-end GPU-s instead of CPU-s. Option Description --start-mining Specify wallet address to mining for. This must be a main address ! It can be neither a subaddres nor integrated address. --mining-threads Specify mining threads count. By default ony one thread will be used. For best results, set it to number of your physical cores. --extra-messages-file Specify file for extra messages to include into coinbase transactions. --bg-mining-enable Enable unobtrusive mining. In this mode mining will use a small percentage of your system resources to never noticeably slow down your computer. This is intended to encourage people to mine to improve decentralization. That being said chances of finding a block are diminishingly small with solo CPU mining, and even lesser with its unobtrusive version. You can tweak the unobtrusivness / power trade-offs with the further --bg-* options below. --bg-mining-ignore-battery If true, assumes plugged in when unable to query system power status. --bg-mining-min-idle-interval Specify min lookback interval in seconds for determining idle state. --bg-mining-idle-threshold Specify minimum avg idle percentage over lookback interval. --bg-mining-miner-target Specify maximum percentage cpu use by miner(s). Testing Loki itself \u00b6 These options are useful for Loki project developers and testers. Normal users shouldn't be concerned with these. Option Description --test-drop-download For net tests: in download, discard ALL blocks instead checking/saving them (very fast). --test-drop-download-height Like test-drop-download but discards only after around certain height. By default 0 . --regtest Run in a regression testing mode. --fixed-difficulty Fixed difficulty used for testing. By default 0 . --test-dbg-lock-sleep Sleep time in ms, defaults to 0 (off), used to debug before/after locking mutex. Values 100 to 1000 are good for tests. --save-graph Save data for dr Loki. Legacy \u00b6 These options should no longer be necessary. They are still present in lokid for backwards compatibility. Option Description --fluffy-blocks Relay compact blocks. Default. Compact block is just a header and a list of transaction IDs. --no-fluffy-blocks Relay classic full blocks. Classic block contains all transactions. --show-time-stats Official docs say \"Show time-stats when processing blocks/txs and disk synchronization\" but it does not seem to produce any output during usual blockchain synchronization. --zmq-rpc-bind-ip IP for ZMQ RPC server to listen on. By default 127.0.0.1 . This is not yet widely used as ZMQ interface currently does not provide meaningful advantage over classic JSON-RPC interface. Unfortunately, currently there is no way to disable the ZMQ server. --zmq-rpc-bind-port Port for ZMQ RPC server to listen on. By default 22024 for mainnet, 38154 for stagenet, and 38158 for testnet. --db-type Specify database type. The default and only available: lmdb . Commands \u00b6 Commands give access to specific services provided by the daemon. Commands are executed against the running daemon. Their names follow the command_name pattern. The following groups are only to make reference easier to follow. The daemon itself does not group commands in any way. See running for example usage. You can also type commands directly in the console of the running lokid (if not detached). Help, version, status \u00b6 Option Description help [<command>] Show help for <command> . version Show version information. Example output: Loki 'Festive Freya' (v2.0.2-68397db6) status Show status. Example output: Height: 186754/186754 (100.0%) on stagenet, not mining, net hash 317 H/s, v9, up to date, 8(out)+0(in) connections, uptime 0d 3h 48m 47s P2P network \u00b6 Option Description print_pl Show the full peer list. print_pl_stats Show the full peer list statistics (white vs gray peers). White peers are online and reachable. Grey peers are offline but your lokid remembers them from past sessions. print_cn Show connected peers with connection initiative (incoming/outgoing) and other stats. ban <IP> [<seconds>] Ban a given <IP> for a given amount of <seconds> .

This is where the blockchain, log files, and p2p network memory are stored. For defaults and details see data directory. --pidfile Full path to the PID file. Works only with --detach . Example: ./lokid --detach --pidfile=/run/loki/lokid.pid --detach Go to background (decouple from the terminal). This is useful for long-running / server scenarios. Typically, you will also want to manage lokid daemon with systemd or similar. By default lokid runs in a foreground. --non-interactive Do not require tty in a foreground mode. Helpful when running in a container. By default lokid runs in a foreground and opens stdin for reading. This breaks containerization because no tty gets assigned and lokid process crashes. You can make it run in a background with --detach but this is inconvenient in a containerized environment because the canonical usage is that the container waits on the main process to exist (forking makes things more complicated). --no-igd Disable UPnP port mapping on the router (\"Internet Gateway Device\"). Add this option to improve security if you are not behind a NAT (you can bind directly to public IP or you run through Tor). --max-txpool-weight Set maximum transactions pool size in bytes.

This is for node-to-node communication. The following options do not affect wallet-to-node interface. The node and peer words are used interchangeably. Option Description --p2p-bind-ip Network interface to bind to for p2p network protocol. Default value 0.0.0.0 binds to all network interfaces. This is typically what you want. You must change this if you want to constrain binding, for example to configure connection through Tor via torsocks: DNS_PUBLIC=tcp://1.1.1.1 TORSOCKS_ALLOW_INBOUND=1 torsocks ./lokid --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1\u200a--no-igd\u200a--hide-my-port --p2p-bind-port TCP port to listen for p2p network connections.

This is helpful to run several nodes on your machine to simulate private Loki p2p network (likely using private Testnet). Example: ./lokid --p2p-bind-port=48080 --p2p-bind-port-ipv6 TCP port to listen for p2p network connections. Defaults to 22022 for mainnet, 38156 for testnet, and 38153 for stagenet. --p2p-bind-ipv6-address Interface for p2p network protocol. --p2p-use-ipv6 Enable IPv6 for p2p. --p2p-external-port TCP port to listen for p2p network connections on your router. Relevant if you are behind a NAT and still want to accept incoming connections. You must then set this to relevant port on your router. This is to let lokid know what to advertise on the network. Default is 0 . --hide-my-port lokid will still open and listen on the p2p port. However, it will not announce itself as a peer list candidate. Technically, it will return port 0 in a response to p2p handshake ( node_data.my_port = 0 in get_local_node_data function). In effect nodes you connect to won't spread your IP to other nodes. To sum up, it is not really hiding, it is more like \"do not advertise\". --seed-node Connect to a node to retrieve other nodes' addresses, and disconnect. If not specified, lokid will use hardcoded seed nodes on the first run, and peers cached on disk on subsequent runs. --add-peer Manually add node to local peer list. --add-priority-node Specify list of nodes to connect to and then attempt to keep the connection open. To add multiple nodes use the option several times. Example: ./lokid --add-priority-node=178.128.192.138:18081 --add-priority-node=144.76.202.167:18081 --add-exclusive-node Specify list of nodes to connect to only. If this option is given the options --add-priority-node and --seed-node are ignored. To add multiple nodes use the option several times.

It serves 3 purposes: provides network data (stats, blocks, transactions, ...) provides local node information (peer list, hash rate if mining, ...) provides interface for wallets (send transactions, ...) This API is typically referred to as \"RPC\" because it is mostly based on JSON/RPC standard. The following options define how the API behaves. Option Description --rpc-bind-ip IP to listen on. By default 127.0.0.1 because API gives full administrative capabilities over the node. Set it to 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces - but only in connection with one of *-restricted-* options and --confirm-external-bind . --rpc-bind-port TCP port to listen on. By default 22023 (mainnet), 38157 (testnet), 38154 (stagenet). --rpc-restricted-bind-port TCP port to listen on with the limited version of API. The limited API can be made public to create an Open Node. At the same time, you may firewall the full API port to still enjoy local querying and administration. --confirm-external-bind Confirm you consciously set --rpc-bind-ip to non-localhost IP and you understand the consequences. --restricted-rpc Restrict API to view only commands and do not return privacy sensitive data. Note this does not make sense with --rpc-restricted-bind-port because you would end up with two restricted APIs. --rpc-login Specify username[:password] required to connect to API. Practical usage seems limited because API communication is in plain text over HTTP. --rpc-access-control-origins Specify a comma separated list of origins to allow cross origin resource sharing. This is useful if you want to use lokid API directly from a web browser via JavaScript (say in a pure-fronted web appp scenario). With this option lokid will put proper HTTP CORS headers to its responses. You will also need to set --rpc-login if you use this option.

The fast:async:* can corrupt blockchain database in case of a system crash. It should not corrupt if just lokid crashes. If you are concerned with system crashes use safe:sync . --max-concurrency Max number of threads to use for a parallel jobs. The default value 0 uses the number of CPU threads. --prep-blocks-threads Max number of threads to use when computing block hashes (PoW) in groups. Defaults to 4. Decrease this if you don't want lokid hog your computer when syncing. --fast-block-sync Sync up most of the way by using embedded, \"known\" block hashes. Pass 1 to turn on and 0 to turn off. This is on ( 1 ) by default. Normally, for every block the full node must calculate the block hash to verify miner's proof of work. Because the CryptoNight PoW used in Loki is very expensive (even for verification), lokid offers skipping these calculations for old blocks. In other words, it's a mechanism to trust lokid binary regarding old blocks' PoW validity, to sync up faster. --block-sync-size How many blocks are processed in a single batch during chain synchronization. By default this is 20 blocks for newer history and 100 blocks for older history (\"pre v4\"). Default behavior is represented by value 0 . Intuitively, the more resources you have, the bigger batch size you may want to try out. Example: ./lokid --block-sync-size=500 --bootstrap-daemon-address The host:port of a \"bootstrap\" remote open node that the connected wallets can use while this node is still not fully synced. Example: ./lokid --bootstrap-daemon-address=opennode.xmr-tw.org:18089 . The node will forward selected RPC calls to the bootstrap node. The wallet will handle this automatically and transparently. Obviously, such bootstraping phase has privacy implications similar to directly using a remote node. --bootstrap-daemon-login Specify username:password for the bootstrap daemon login (if required).

Editing the files on Github. Building the website and editing the content locally. This guide will teach you how to build the website and edit it on your local machine. Requirements: \u00b6 You will need the following software packages: Python Pip Mkdocs github Step 1: Installing Python and Pip \u00b6 If you have and use a package manager (such as apt-get , dnf , homebrew , yum , chocolatey , etc.) to install packages on your system, then you may want to search for a \"MkDocs\" package and, if a recent version is available, install it with your package manager (check your system's documentation for details). That's it, you're done! If your package manager does not have a recent \"MkDocs\" package, you can still use your package manager to install \"Python\" and \"pip\". Then you can use pip to install MkDocs . Manual Installation \u00b6 In order to manually install MkDocs you'll need Python installed on your system, as well as the Python package manager, pip . You can check if you have these already installed from the command line: $ python --version Python 2.7.2 $ pip --version pip 1.5.2 MkDocs supports Python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and pypy. Installing Python \u00b6 Install Python by downloading an installer appropriate for your system from python.org and running it. Note : If you are installing Python on Windows, be sure to check the box to have Python added to your PATH if the installer offers such an option (it's normally off by default). Installing pip \u00b6 If you're using a recent version of Python, the Python package manager, pip , is most likely installed by default. However, you may need to upgrade pip to the lasted version: pip install --upgrade pip If you need to install pip for the first time, download get-pip.py . Then run the following command to install it: python get-pip.py Step 2: Installing MkDocs \u00b6 Install the mkdocs package using pip: pip install mkdocs You should now have the mkdocs command installed on your system. Run mkdocs --version to check that everything worked okay. $ mkdocs --version mkdocs, version 0.15.3 For a more permanent solution, you may need to edit your PATH environment variable to include the Scripts directory of your Python installation. Recent versions of Python include a script to do this for you. Navigate to your Python installation directory (for example C:\\Python34), open the Tools, then Scripts folder, and run the win_add2path.py file by double clicking on it. Alternatively, you can download the script and run it (python win_add2path.py). Step 3: Download the loki-docs files \u00b6 Now that we have mkdocs, python and pip we can download the repository to our local machine and start working on making changes. We can download the files by typing in the terminal: git clone [https://github.com/loki-project/loki-docs](https://github.com/loki-project/loki-docs) You can now edit the text files locally and create pull requests when you make changes Step 4: Making changes to loki-docs \u00b6 I would suggest downloading a txt editor called sublime. In sublime click open folder and open the loki-docs directory within the software. You\u2019re screen should look similar to the below. Go into the docs folder and open the desired .md file you want to edit. For the below example we are going to go into LokiNetwork.md which is in the introduction folder. From here you can edit the file using markdown syntax. Any changes you make will automatically show up as a potential pull request. If you have the Github gui for windows you will first need to add the local repository folder. And now if we make any changes the Github gui will know straight away the changes we have made. Once you\u2019ve made all your changes click commit to master. Step 5: Local testing \u00b6 Change directories to your loki-docs local repository. cd loki-docs From here we can type in the terminal: mkdocs serve This will run Mkdocs built in development server. When the mkdocs serve command is running any changes saved to your local repository files will be updated onto your built site. Any issues such as links to websites or documentation that is not there or not working will show as a error when serving. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in web browser to view the changes you\u2019ve made prior to committing them to the Loki-docs Github. Additional: Changing the filepaths on Loki-docs. \u00b6 The file in our loki-docs folder called mkdocs.yml is where we edit the left sidebar on the Loki-docs website. If you create any new guides you will need to save the file as a .md file within a folder that is relevant. You must also then add it to the mkdocs.yml file similar to the below.

If submission proves to be vulnerable with PoC code / exploit, proceed to next step b. If not vulnerable: i . DA responds with reasons why submission is not a vulnerability ii . DA moves discussion to a new or existing ticket on GitHub if necessary DA Establishes severity of vulnerability: a. HIGH : impacts network as a whole, has potential to break entire Loki network, or service nodes, could result in the loss of Loki. b. MEDIUM : impacts individual nodes, routers, wallets, or must be carefully exploited c. LOW : is not easily exploitable or is low impact d. If there are any disputes regarding bug severity, the Loki Foundation will ultimately define bug severity Respond according to the severity of the vulnerability: a. HIGH severities must be notified on website and reddit /r/LokiProject within 3 working days of classification i . The notification should list appropriate steps for users to take, if any ii . The notification must not include any details that could suggest an exploitation path iii . The latter takes precedence over the former b. MEDIUM and HIGH severities will require a Point Release c. LOW severities will be addressed in the next Regular Release DA and Loki project team will apply appropriate patch(es) a. DA designates a PRIVATE git \"hotfix branch\" to work in b. Patches are reviewed with the researcher c. Any messages associated with PUBLIC commits during the time of review should not make reference to the security nature of the PRIVATE branch or its commits d. Vulnerability announcement is drafted i . Include the severity of the vulnerability ii . Include all vulnerable systems/apps/code iii . Include solutions (if any) if patch cannot be applied e. Release date is discussed At release date, DA coordinates with developers to finalize update: a. Response Manager propagates the \"hotfix branch\" to trunk b. Response Manager includes vulnerability announcement draft in release notes c. Proceed with the Point or Regular Release 3. Post-release disclosure process \u00b6 The DA has 90 days to fulfill all points within section 2 If the Incident Response process in section 2 is successfully completed: a. Researcher decides whether or not to opt out of receiving name/handle/organization credit. By default, the researcher will receive name/handle/organization credit. i . If bounty is applicable, release bounty to the researcher as defined in section \"Bounty Distribution\" b. Finalize vulnerability announcement draft and include the following: i . Project name and URL ii . Versions known to be affected iii . Versions known to be not affected (for example, the vulnerable code was introduced in a recent version, and older versions are therefore unaffected) iv . Versions not checked v . Type of vulnerability and its impact vi . If already obtained or applicable, a CVE-ID vii . The planned, coordinated release date viii . Mitigating factors (for example, the vulnerability is only exposed in uncommon, non-default configurations) ix . Workarounds (configuration changes users can make to reduce their exposure to the vulnerability) x . If applicable, credits to the original reporter c. Release finalized vulnerability announcement on website and reddit d. If applicable, developers request a CVE-ID i . The commit that applied the fix is made reference too in a future commit and includes a CVE-ID If the Incident Response process in section 2 is not successfully completed: a. DA and developers organize a meeting to discuss why/what points in section 2 were not resolved and how the team can resolve them in the future b. If disputes arise about whether or when to disclose information about a vulnerability, the DA will publicly discuss the issue via IRC and attempt to reach consensus c. If consensus on a timely disclosure is not met (no later than 90 days), the researcher (after 90 days) has every right to expose the vulnerability to the public 4. Bounty Amount and distribution \u00b6 The Total Pool of Loki bounties is 100,000 LOK this will decrease over time as bugs are claimed, rewards are given as a percentage of the reward pool size, incentivizing fast disclosure Bug bounties are rewarded by the severity of the Bug 10% reserved for LOW severity bugs 30% reserved for MEDIUM severity bugs 60% for HIGH severity bugs Each bug will receive at most 10% of their relevant category dependent on the inter-category classification by the DA, the DA also reserves the right to give less than the 10% specified depending on the severity of the bug.

Many RPC calls use the daemon's JSON RPC interface while others use their own interfaces, as demonstrated below. Note: \"atomic units\" refer to the smallest fraction of 1 LOKI according to the lokid implementation. 1 LOKI = 1e12 atomic units. JSON RPC Methods: \u00b6 get_block_count on_get_block_hash get_block_template submit_block get_last_block_header get_block_header_by_hash get_block_header_by_height get_block_headers_range get_block get_connections get_info hard_fork_info set_bans get_bans flush_txpool get_output_histogram get_version get_coinbase_tx_sum get_fee_estimate get_alternate_chains relay_tx sync_info get_txpool_backlog get_output_distribution Other RPC Methods: \u00b6 /get_height /get_blocks.bin /get_blocks_by_height.bin /get_hashes.bin /get_o_indexes.bin /get_outs.bin /get_transactions /get_alt_blocks_hashes /is_key_image_spent /send_raw_transaction /start_mining /stop_mining /mining_status /save_bc /get_peer_list /set_log_hash_rate /set_log_level /set_log_categories /get_transaction_pool /get_transaction_pool_hashes.bin /get_transaction_pool_stats /stop_daemon /get_info (not JSON) /get_limit /set_limit /out_peers /in_peers /start_save_graph /stop_save_graph /get_outs /update JSON RPC Methods \u00b6 The majority of lokid RPC calls use the daemon's json_rpc interface to request various bits of information.

Outputs: blob - string; Hexadecimal blob of block information. block_header - A structure containing block header information. See get_last_block_header . json - json string; JSON formatted block details: major_version - Same as in block header. minor_version - Same as in block header. timestamp - Same as in block header. prev_id - Same as prev_hash in block header. nonce - Same as in block header. miner_tx - Miner transaction information version - Transaction version number. unlock_time - The block height when the coinbase transaction becomes spendable. vin - List of transaction inputs: gen - Miner txs are coinbase txs, or \"gen\". height - This block height, a.k.a. when the coinbase is generated. vout - List of transaction outputs. Each output contains: amount - The amount of the output, in atomic units. target - key - extra - Usually called the \"transaction ID\" but can be used to include any random 32 byte/64 character hex string. signatures - Contain signatures of tx signers. Coinbased txs do not have signatures. tx_hashes - List of hashes of non-coinbase transactions in the block. If there are no other transactions, this will be an empty list. status - string; General RPC error code. \"OK\" means everything looks good. untrusted - boolean; States if the result is obtained using the bootstrap mode, and is therefore not trusted ( true ), or when the daemon is fully synced ( false ).

This section gives examples of these calls. The data structure for these calls is different than the JSON RPC calls. Whereas the JSON RPC methods were called using the /json_rpc extension and specifying a method, these methods are called at their own extensions. For example: IP=127.0.0.1 PORT=18081 METHOD='gettransactions' PARAMS='{\"txs_hashes\":[\"d6e48158472848e6687173a91ae6eebfa3e1d778e65252ee99d7515d63090408\"]}' curl \\ -X POST http://$IP:$PORT/$METHOD \\ -d $PARAMS \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' Note: It is recommended to use JSON RPC where such alternatives exist, rather than the following methods. For example, the recommended way to get a node's height is via the JSON RPC methods get_info or get_last_block_header , rather than getheight below.

As a side effect of this, in the get_block_template json response, expected_reward now returns only the miner reward instead of the entire block reward.

Summary \u00b6 Blink is Loki\u2019s instant payment mechanism proposed in the original Loki whitepaper. Once completed, Blink will allow users to send payments instantly to each other and allow instantly resend of received Blink transactions without requiring blockchain confirmations. This document is intended to serve as a whitepaper underlying the concrete design for the implementation of Loki Blink with an expectation of inclusion in the 5.0.0 release. 2. Abstract \u00b6 Blink takes advantage of Loki\u2019s service node layer and checkpointing mechanism to provide a strong assurance that a transaction will eventually reach the blockchain without risk of various adversarial attacks cancelling the transaction. It does this by using multiple quorums to validate a transfer and block conflicting transfers. This validation in combination with checkpointing and updated blockchain consensus rules help ensure that such validated transfers have a strong assurance of reaching the transaction memory pool and thus can be relied upon without requiring mining confirmations. 3. Blink from the user perspective \u00b6 3.1. Wallet side \u00b6 From the user (wallet) side, initiating a Blink transfer is nearly identical to initiating a normal transfer, but with an extra flag (e.g. GUI checkbox, RPC parameter, CLI option) to say \u201cBlink this transaction!\u201d. The fees of the blink transaction are higher as it involves considerably more work for the network: service nodes must validate the transaction, and all nodes must perform extra validation steps and require some temporary extra storage to store recent Blink transaction details. For the user receiving a blink transaction, the wallet will see the received amount virtually instantly (that is, as soon as it is received by the lokid and the wallet refreshes with the daemon). Moreover these funds will be instantly spendable: unlike a regular transaction there will be no lock on the received funds before they can be spent again. The wallet user can immediately re-Blink the funds to someone else, or can send off a regular (non-Blink) transaction that spends the received Blink outputs instantly without needing to wait for the Blink transaction to be mined into a block. 3.2. Re-blinking \u00b6 One of the goals of Blink is the ability to \u201cre-Blink\u201d: That is, we want a Blink transaction to be instantly available to the recipient indistinguishable from a (confirmed) non-Blink transaction from a usability perspective. For example, when Ava blinks 10 LOKI to Betty then that transaction is initially still in the mempool, but we don\u2019t want Betty to have to worry about this technical detail: instead Betty can instantly Blink it to someone else, send a regular transaction, or use it to stake a new service node without waiting for even a single confirmation. 3.3. Fees \u00b6 The precise fee schedule is yet to be determined, but will be an additional amount on top of the current transaction fee, most likely calculated as a multiple of the transaction fee. Additionally, Blink transactions will not have a choice in transaction priority: since they are instantly spendable and guaranteed by the network, there would be little point in a user ever choosing anything higher than the minimum. Thus, for now, we mandate that Blink fees must always be submitted with a \u201cnormal\u201d priority transaction fee (but this is tentative and may be adjust this before final Blink release). The extra Blink fee doesn\u2019t go to anyone: rather it gets permanently destroyed as part of the transaction. We considered two alternatives here: Collecting fees and redistributing to SN over time. This would involve temporarily burning Blink fees, but keeping track of how much had been burned and continually reemitting them over a period of time as an extra rewards to Service Nodes. (For example: in every block, reduce the current pool of burned fees by 0.1% and reemit it to the service nodes that earn a reward in that block). Just burning fees. Ultimately we decided on the second approach because: It is much simpler. It is more predictable: SN rewards (for a stable number of service nodes) are known precisely. In the end, the two approaches are effectively equivalent in terms of total emission. By equivalent I am assuming that we have a specific net emission target. For simplicity, I\u2019ll just talk about the long-term 28 LOKI/block emissions, and, for the sake of example, assume that it is divided up so that service nodes get 20 LOKI/block of that; [1] the remaining 8 is foundation and miner coinbase rewards. What I mean by net emission is that if we have an average burning of 5 LOKI/block in Blink fees, then the net emission would 23 LOKI/block. But let\u2019s suppose that 25 LOKI/block is our actual desired long-run emission target. With method 1, we\u2019re emitting 28 LOKI/block: burned Blink fees are reemitted over time and so, much like regular tx fees, there is no net gain or loss. To hit the 25 LOKI/block target we\u2019d have to adjust the formula to reduce emissions to 25 LOKI/block. With method 2, where we are burning 5 LOKI/block in fees, we are generate net emissions of 23 LOKI/block; to hit the same 25 LOKI/block target, then, we would need to increase coinbase emissions by 2 LOKI/block to hit our target. Either way we arrive at the same place: net emissions of 25 LOKI/block through adjustment of the emission schedule. This was just an example, of course; our actual target could be 20 or 28 or 12 or whatever else. But with method 2, service nodes always know exactly what they will earn, while with method 1 there is more variability: large, sustained differences in the volume of Blink transactions will affect SN profitability, while in method 2 such differences will affect the overall coin emission but not the amount earned by a service node. Thus, given the simpler approach and essential equivalence between the two approaches, we decided to pursue method 2. (Of course, like anything in Loki, we can always change the design later given compelling reasons to do so!) 4. Technical design \u00b6 4.1. Transaction overview \u00b6 In a nutshell (with most of the details covered later in this document): The wallet builds a transaction and sends it to the lokid to be blinked. The lokid then looks up the Blink quorum, connects to a few nodes in this quorum, sending the transaction to them to be signed. The quorum distributes the transaction within itself, and once enough approval signatures are collected, broadcasts the transaction and signature data to the service node\u2019s p2p peers to disseminate it across the network. The lokid talking to the quorum then receives a confirmation message (with signatures) to relay to the wallet. These steps are depicted in Figure 1. Note that the diagram has been significantly simplified for illustration to show only three service nodes per quorum rather than the actual ten. In more detail: The wallet constructs a transaction. This transaction is almost like a regular transaction except that it leaves enough inputs unspent to cover both the required mining transaction fee and the Blink fee. This transaction gets send to the wallet\u2019s lokid for handling. lokid looks at the transaction, does some preliminary checks (as it would with any transaction) and additional checks related to the Blink transaction (such as having the correct transaction priority and blink fee). These checks are not strictly required for network security\u2014they will also be done by the service nodes \u2014 but can give an immediate failure response to the wallet if the node reasonably believes the transaction will fail. Assuming the preliminary checks pass, the node then uses the current blockchain height to determine the transaction\u2019s signing height, h . This h value then determines two current Blink quorums, Q and Q\u2019 (more details on quorum construction are in the Quorum selection section below). The lokid handling the transaction connects directly to 2 nodes selected randomly from each quorum and sends the transaction (plus other required details such as h ) to be signed. The receiving quorum nodes directly contacted by the initiating lokid forward the transaction details to the other quorum nodes for verification. Each service node in the two quorums performs checks on the validity of the transaction, such as ensuring that it isn\u2019t already spent, that it isn\u2019t already in the mempool, that miner and Blink fees are correctly specified, and that the requested signature height, h , h is approximately current (within 2 blocks of what the service node believes is the current height), and that the key images have not been already locked out by a previous, different Blink transaction signing. Assuming everything checks out, the service node records the transaction\u2019s key images locally (to lock them out from being signed again by this service node), signs the transaction hash with the service node private key, and sends the signature to the other quorum members. As each of the quorum members receives a supermajority of valid signatures (i.e. 7 in total) from both quorums it immediately sends out the transaction and signature details to its blockchain peers via its p2p network. If the quorum node in question is one of the nodes that was directly contacted by lokid, it additionally communicates the success back to the caller. These signed mempool transactions, however, are much stronger than a regular mempool transaction in that they can trigger a reorg or lead to rejected blocks: more details on this are covered below. In the case of detectable failure (for example, from a detected double-spend confirmed by a sufficient number of service nodes), a failure message is returned to the caller. If a failure is caused by too many quorum nodes timing out the caller is expected to itself timeout after an appropriate amount of time waiting for a response. The initiating lokid waits for success, failure, or timeout from the quorum nodes it contacted, and once received (or timed out), sends this information back to the wallet. 4.2. Quorum selection \u00b6 Quorum selection works by using the requested signing height h to deterministically select the two relevant quorums, Q and Q\u2019 . A quorum Q is determined by the 5-block range within which h falls, and Q\u2019 is the quorum for the immediately subsequent 5-block range. For example, any h value in 1000\u20131004 will yield the same Q and Q\u2019 quorums, and this Q\u2019 will be exactly the same quorum as the Q quorum for an h value in the 1005\u20131009 signing height range. In other words, Q\u2019(h=1003) and Q(h=1006) are the same quorum . All service nodes in Q and Q\u2019 refuse to sign a transaction with a requested signing height h that is more than 2 blocks behind or ahead of the service node\u2019s current blockchain height: this is to allow some tolerance for Blink transactions to succeed even if new blocks are propagating through the network during the Blink transaction signing process. This \u00b12 tolerance is designed to make the user experience better: using a node that is slightly out of sync [2] will still work fine rather than returning a Blink failure. It also avoids potential Blink failures on the part of quorum nodes: if a block happens to arrive during the actual signing process such that half of the quorum see the new block and half see the old block the quorum will still sign without issue. On the other hand the \u00b12 limit on the signing height also prevents abuse: the larger the allowed range, the more choices a malicious actor would have to pick and choose a \u201cfriendly\u201d quorum. The quorum sample itself needs to be effectively immutable, and so we propose a deterministic random sampling using a MT19937-64 random number generator seeded with the block hash 35 blocks before the first valid quorum height, h\u2080 . Thus quorum Q for height 1002 is determined by block 965 (35 blocks before the first signing height of the quorum, h\u2080 =1000), and quorum Q\u2019 is determined by block 970 (35 blocks before the first height of the second quorum, h\u2019\u2080 =1005). Moreover the sampling algorithm excludes any service nodes that are scheduled to expire before block h\u2080 +10. For validation of a Blink transaction we require a supermajority of signatures from both quorums. The point here of using the two quorums is to prevent a timing conflict where, if we had just one quorum per block (or range of blocks), then one Blink transaction could be signed by quorum Q\u2081 and another transaction spending the same keys could be signed by quorum Q\u2082 before the first transaction is broadcast to the network. By using two overlapping quorums we end up with the key images in question being locked both in the current quorum but also in the following quorum (which could come as early as the next block). Even if the next Blink transaction switches to a new quorum, the overlap ensures that it simply switching to a quorum that has already locked any key images of Blink transactions submitted in the last few blocks. 4.2.1. Overlapping quorums rationale \u00b6 There are three reasons for using these two overlapping quorums. First, we want the quorum signature process to \u201creach\u201d a few blocks into the future (5\u20139 blocks ahead with 5-block quorums) to give enough time for the quorum signatures to disseminate across the network. While 5 blocks is more than would be typically required, there are some edge cases discussed in detail below that can lower this future block interval to just 2 blocks. Second, Blink processing is expected to require a substantial number of connections between service nodes; with 5-block quorums we can at least reduce the frequency with which connections need to be established as service nodes will keep their connections open for the duration of the quorum. Third, using two quorums offers considerable higher security than one quorum of twice the size for two reasons. First, each quorum is essentially a new random draw of service nodes; that means the more quorums you have over a given period of time the more random draws you do, and with more draws you get more \u201cchances\u201d to pick a compromised sample. Second, two consecutive supermajorities of quorums of half the size is considerably more secure than one supermajority of a quorum twice the size. Some numbers can help demonstrate this: suppose the network has 1000 service nodes, and a single malicious actor is in control of 25% of those service nodes. Under alternative A, we require the majority of a single quorum of 20 service nodes, and require a 70% of the service nodes\u2019 signatures. Under alternative B, we require two quorums of 10 service nodes each, again requiring 70% signatures from each quorum. Under scenario A in any given quorum the actor has a probability of 0.00000381 of having the required 70% majority. Under scenario B, the actor has a probability of 0.000000173: that is, under scenario A, the actor is about 22 times more likely to obtain control of any random quorum than any random quorum pair. Or to put it into context: in a one year span, there\u2019s about an 18% chance that this bad actor would gain quorum control for at least a single quorum under scenario A, and about a 0.9% chance that he would under scenario B. As for quorum length, if quorums lasted for one block instead of five there would be a 4.4% chance of this 25% operator having a quorum supermajority at least once under the overlapping quorum design, and a 63% chance under the single quorum design. If this adversary actually controlled an incredible 50% of the service node network it would be quite difficult to avoid a compromise: he would have quorum supermajority votes about 2% of the time under the single quorum approach, and 0.3% of the time under the overlapping quorum approach. Such an adversary would have a 95% chance of quorum ownership at least once per day with a quorum of 20, and a 35% chance per day with overlapping quorums. It is worth pointing out, in passing, that these probabilities are countered by the economic design of Loki: even if such adversaries existed, they would have a strong financial incentive to ensure that the network is not compromised as such a compromise would likely have a significant negative impact on their own holdings, which are heavily invested and locked into service node stakes. There is, of course, some desirable statistical properties of making a quorum longer : if quorums changed on a 10 block cycle you\u2019d cut the probability of compromise by nearly half (to 0.45% in the overlapping case). This gain isn\u2019t huge, though; moreover the longer the quorum becomes the more complications can arise from service node deregistrations, and the more time you allow for coordination between service node operators looking to cheat the system. Instead, if we wanted to further increase the security of Blink transactions, a preferable approach would be to use a triple quorum. It could also be possible to enable an opt-in triple quorum, at a higher fee, to allow users to send with a paranoid level of assurance. (This is now, however, part of the current Blink plan.) 4.2.2. Quorum selection block and checkpointing rationale \u00b6 Using a lag of 30 blocks for quorum determination was chosen to interact with Loki checkpointing. Unlike checkpointing and deregistration quorums, a change in Blink quorums would be highly undesirable as the validity of the Blink signature would no longer hold. Thus we want to use a height from the blockchain that is sufficiently far back as to be highly likely to be made immutable via checkpointing. By basing the quorum on h\u2080 -30 we give ample time for checkpointing even if 2-3 checkpoints have been missed. For example, if blinking at height 1000 then Q\u2019 begins at 1005, which means the relevant block for determination of Q\u2019 is 975. Checkpointing normally occurs every 4 blocks with immutability occurring after 3 checkpoints. Thus in typical times it can be up to 4 blocks since the last checkpoint quorum, which itself establishes a checkpoint on a block 4 blocks earlier. Allowing up to 2 blocks for the quorum to vote and disseminate the checkpoint to the network this means the first checkpoint is usually between 4 and 10 blocks ago, the second is 8-14 blocks ago, and the third, immutable checkpoint is 12-18 blocks ago. If one of these checkpoints were missed (for example because of a quorum failure) then the immutable checkpoint could be 16-22 blocks ago; and if three were missed, up to 30 blocks ago. Thus the h\u2080 -35 rule establishes that both quorum selections are established by a block at least 30 blocks in the past, which allows Blink to tolerate up to 3 missing checkpoints. To further secure Blink transactions we further require that the quorum seed heights are checkpoint-immutable: both the initiating lokid and the quorum service nodes will verify that the quorum seed height is in fact checkpointed, refusing to sign (and thus failing the Blink if enough fail to see the required checkpoints) if it is not. This ensures that Blink transactions are secure by preferring to fail a Blink signature rather than include one that has any chance of being invalidated by a block reorganization. 4.3. Quorum validation \u00b6 Some potential cases are depicted below: 4.3.1. TX example one \u00b6 TX\u2081 is depicting a transaction submitted to a daemon which sees the current height of the network at 1002. We can think about a few different cases: Submitting the blink transaction normally at the known height (1002). Thus we get Q = Q\u2081 and Q\u2019 = Q\u2082 for the two quorums. The initiating lokid contacts a random service node q from Q\u2081 , passes along the transaction, and waits for a reply from q . q in turn communicates with its quorum peers and the subsequent quorum ( Q\u2082 ) to build the required set of signatures. Once the required signatures are accumulated the transaction is released by the quorum service nodes to their peers. The Blink TX is broadcast to the network. Because a majority of Q\u2082 service nodes signed it and will not resign the same key images, the earliest possible Blink height to spend the same key images is 1010, which can be used by a cheating lokid at network block 1008 at the earliest. Submitting slightly behind the network (1000 or 1001). This could happen, for instance, because there have been two recent blocks that the local lokid has not synchronized yet. Generally everything here works as above: the service nodes at height 1002 will still sign the block (assuming the transaction itself is valid) because the requested signature height is within 2 of their current height. Submitting slightly ahead of the network (1003 or 1004). This could happen, for instance, if the local node is close to a very lucky pool that has just discovered a couple blocks that haven\u2019t disseminated across the network yet. Again, this is handled just like the above: even though the service nodes haven\u2019t yet seen a block newer than 1002 it still satisfies the within-2 rule and so they will still sign (assuming the transaction is valid). Submitting well behind or well ahead of the network (999 or lower, or 1005 or higher). In this case the quorum will not accumulate enough signatures because the within-2 requirement is violated. In this case a failure gets returned to the initiating lokid. [3] The first three (accepted) cases above all result in the earliest block a cheater could submit to being 1008 (i.e. abusing the within-2 rule to submit a h=1010 block), giving a worst case of at least 4 blocks needing to be transmitted to the network before a duplicate Blink could be submitted; since Blink dissemination is high-priority this should result in a high level of assuredness that a Blink double-spend cannot be performed in this scenario. 4.3.2. TX example two \u00b6 TX\u2082 in Figure 2 shows a transaction that is sent via a lokid that sees the current h=1006 , i.e. in the second block of quorum Q\u2082 . I\u2019ll just ignore the h>1008 and h\\<1004 cases (see above for why they are dead ends). Case 1: Submitting h =1005, 1006, 1007, 1008. This case is largely the same as TX\u2081 , but now the two quorums are Q\u2082 and Q\u2083 . The earlier a theoretical double-spending Blink could be submitted is with h =1015 at actual height 1013: that is, a minimum of 5 network blocks away. Case 2: Submitting h =1004 (either due to a lagging node, or a malicious actor). This ends up using the same quorums as TX\u2081 (that is, Q\u2081 and Q\u2082 ). As in TX\u2081 , the earliest possible double spend could be submitted at 1008. Case 2 here represents the worst possible scenario: there are just two network blocks between the current height (1006) and the height at which a blink transaction could be submitted to a completely independent quorum pair. There is a potential issue here from an attacker, discussed in further detail below. 4.3.3. TX example three \u00b6 TX\u2083 is included for completeness to show that cheating ahead by a quorum has no advantage for a potential attacker. This depicts the sending transaction at h =1009. The attack essentially has two relevant choices: h =1007\u20131009, or h =1010,1011. In the first case, he gets quorums Q\u2082 and Q\u2083 , making his earlier possible Blink double-spend at h =1015 (submitted at h =1013), which is Stats geek note: the probability of being 3+ blocks behind the network with lag L seconds is the CDF value of a Poisson distribution with \u03bb= L /120 at k =3. 4.4. Repeated signing of the same transaction \u00b6 One possible Blink failure mode is that the requested signature height, h , is seen as too old (or even too new) by some or all members of the service node quorum if it does not fit within their \u00b12 tolerance. This could be caused, for example, by the lokid the wallet is talking to being out of sync. In the case of such a failure, the calling lokid could check for new blocks and, if changed, resubmit the transaction for signing at an updated signing height h . We want this resubmission to succeed even if it goes to the same quorum, as it makes the Blink process more robust to network synchronization issues. This means, in particular, that service nodes will need to add an exception to the normal key image blacklisting if asked to re-sign the exact same transaction for which the key images were blacklisted. 4.5. Signature failure: key images may stay unblinkable (for up to 10 blocks). \u00b6 When a service node signs a transaction as part of a given quorum it will never sign a different transaction containing any of the same key images again as part of that quorum. Since failures are possible for multiple reasons, however, it does not block the key images of a transaction that it refused to sign. It is possible, however, for a transaction to fail to be signed by a supermajority while still being signed by a superminority (that is, by enough other nodes to prevent a supermajority). This case is expected to be rare: the criteria for service node disagreement is small: effectively you would need (roughly) half of the service nodes to see something wrong with the transaction. It is not impossible, however: if a regular transaction spending the same key images is mined and the block transmitted in the middle of signing the blink could fail. The user-facing problem that could arise here is that the transaction that gets signed includes multiple key images, only some of which are ineligible. The service nodes that signed the transaction, however, end up locking all of the key images for the duration of the quorum ( i.e. the next 4\u20139 blocks), so even once the user wallet sees the updated chain a new transaction might end up trying to blink using an input that is temporarily non-blinkable (note that it will still be regularly minable since the Blink was not transmitted due to the quorum failure). This case seems rare: it would require a legitimate user spending regular transactions and blinking at the same time from different wallets. It\u2019s possible, of course, but given the rarity and the relatively minor consequence (not being able to Blink those outputs for 10\u201320 minutes) for now we will simple leave this as a known limitation. 4.6. Blink transactions entering the mempool \u00b6 Blink transactions themselves are perfectly ordinary transactions on the blockchain: the signatures applied by service nodes do not end up as part of the transaction that gets mined into the chain. Instead this metadata is shared and synchronized between nodes from the time when a Blink transaction enters the mempool until the transaction is mined and secured behind an immutable Loki checkpoint boundary. An incoming Blink transaction in the mempool will also be transmitted with the Blink height and the verifiable Blink signatures at which the transaction was signed. Based on this, a loki node receiving a blink transaction will perform multiple actions: Verify that the Blink signatures are the correct signers for the given height, and that the signatures are valid (and if not reject the Blink transaction). Check to see if any of the key images were spent in or before the last irreversible checkpoint block: if so, reject the Blink transaction. Check to see if the mempool already contains any Blink transactions that have a higher priority (i.e. lower height) than the incoming transactions, and if so, refuse the incoming transactions. (This shouldn\u2019t be possible, but is included as a safeguard to maintain consensus). Check the current chain back to the last irreversible checkpoint: if any blocks contain any transactions that spend any of the key images in the new Blink transaction then roll back the chain as much as needed to remove those transactions from the blockchain, re-adding any rolled back transactions into the mempool (as occurs already with any reorg). Reject any non-Blink transaction from the mempool that spend the same key images as the new Blink transaction (if we just rolled back then this means immediately rejecting the conflicting transactions). Reject any Blink transactions from the mempool that spend the same key images but have a lower priority (i.e. higher height) than the new Blink transaction. This should not be possible in general, but needs to be specified anyway to avoid a consensus failure (as with the mirrored check above). Note that this actual removal could cascade if there are other transactions referencing the removed Blink transaction. Another difference with Blink transactions is that they should not be subject to the existing 2-week mempool transaction timeout. We don\u2019t want someone to be able to submit a low-priority Blink transaction while the network is flooded with higher priority transactions and be able to wait out the transaction until timeout. As long as Blink transactions stay in the mempool until mined all an attacker can do is delay the transaction from being mined, but cannot cause it to be dropped no matter how long he prevents mining. In the unlikely event of a bug that makes a Blink transaction inadmissible to the blockchain for some unforeseen reason, this approach will keep the transaction alive indefinitely until the bug can be addressed. [4] Second, Blink transactions need to be more actively propagated across the network than current transactions. Currently the mempool is not actively synchronized across nodes; instead new transactions are simply broadcast to all connected peers when received. A new node, a node that was temporarily down when the transaction propagated across the network, or a node that has had its mempool manually flushed does not receive existing mempool transactions from peers if it misses it the first time. This needs to change for Blink transactions: when a p2p connection is established we need each peer to send the other a list of any pending Blink transaction details it doesn\u2019t already have. Effectively we need Blink transactions in the mempool to become first-class synchronization objects, just like blocks. Finally, synchronized Blink transactions may not be (and do not need to be) identical across the network in terms of attached quorum signatures: it is entirely possible for two nodes to receive a different set of 14 signatures: so long as all are valid for the quorum 4.7. Blink transactions entering the blockchain \u00b6 A transaction entering the blockchain from the mempool requires two changes: first, the Blink transaction\u2019s unspent amount now includes both the tx fee, as before, but now also the Blink fee. Second, because transactions can reference other Blink transactions currently in the mempool this puts an ordering on transactions: if A includes B in its ring signatures (whether as the actual key image or a decoy) then there is an implied ordering for mined block selection: A cannot be included in a block before the block in which B is included. This requires, of course, changes to the transaction selection algorithm used to construct block templates for miners. 4.8. Re-Blinking implementation \u00b6 As discussed in Re-blinking we need received Blink funds to be instantly spendable. That means that the recipient\u2019s wallet needs to recognize that those received funds are immediately spendable, whether in a new non-Blink transaction or in a new Blink transaction. In either case this means the new transaction will spend outputs that aren\u2019t yet on the chain, but are still in pending Blink transactions in the mempool. We need to update lokid and the wallet allow this. This does, however, raise another important issue, addressed in the next section. 4.9. Ring signature implications \u00b6 The anonymity in Loki depends on the actual and decoy outputs being included in the transaction ring signature being indistinguishable. Quick turn-around re-blinking breaks that with the current ring signature selection in two ways: First, a Blink transaction that enters the mempool that includes a mempool Blink transaction in its ring signature provides a perfect link between the transactions because currently only blockchain transactions but not mempool transactions are ever included in a ring signature. Even if you don\u2019t have the mempool history you can still infer likely links between Blink transactions that are very close together (i.e. within a small number of blocks). As outputs in the same block (or within a couple blocks) are highly unlikely to occur naturally, seeing such transactions in the mempool give a high probability that the transactions are linked. [5] To get around this problem, we will need to update the ring signature construction to be able to select from both existing blockchain transactions and Blink transactions in the mempool for both Blink transactions and regular transactions . (This of course imposes additional mempool ordering constraints to those discussed in the blockchain section as ordering also applies to non-Blink transactions using mempool decoys.) Further investigation will be needed to determine a good selection probability (and will likely need tweaking in future releases), but we will aim to be on the side of having too high a probability: using too low a probability is much worse as it would make Blink transactions still stand out (albeit imperfectly). Potentially including mempool Blink transactions in normal transaction ring signatures is important as well: because a Blink transaction is instantly spendable, a non-Blink transaction including a recent Blink transaction would similarly link the outputs together. Thus we potentially include Blink dummy transactions in all transactions (which has the separate advantage of simplifying the code: building a Blink transaction and building a regular transaction will be identical). 4.10. Blink and checkpoints \u00b6 Blink transaction metadata (i.e. quorum signatures, signing height) is meant to be temporary data that only needs to be kept until the transaction is unequivocally committed to the blockchain. Thus Blink is designed to work with Loki\u2019s checkpointing feature: once the transaction has passed the point where it is not reversible\u2014that is, once it has been signed by three checkpoint quorums\u2014service nodes can discard the metadata. 4.11. Quorum communication \u00b6 Current quorum communication (e.g. for deregistration voting or for the upcoming checkpointing support) relies on a gossip protocol to carry messages over the loki p2p layer. While this is manageable for those applications it is not going to be sufficiently scalable for Blink quorum voting. Instead part of the Blink development will be to build a direct communication layer where service nodes connect directly to one another for quorum purposes. The initial plan is for quorum SNs to communicate directly with each (using the SN public IP being added in #622 ). This communication layer will also be designed to handle quorum traffic for service node deregistration and allow faster and more efficient communication in those scenarios as well. The specific implementation details will be developed further during the Blink implementation; the current plan is to create a relatively simple SN-to-SN protocol using ZMQ (which is already a loki core dependency) over which quorum members communicate, and over which the initiating lokid contacts quorum service nodes to begin the Blink signing process. The initial approach here is to use a fully-connected quorum: 9 open connections, roughly half inbound and half outbound, for each SN, held open (and reestablished upon disconnection) for the duration of the Blink quorum validity. As a simple fully connected approach, the following table shows node-to-node connections within a quorum: where \u201co\u201d indicates that the row node establishes an outgoing connection to the column node and \u201ci\u201d indicates that the row node receives an incoming connection from the column node. Additionally once the depicted quorum Q becomes the first quorum, nodes 6\u201310 establish outgoing connections to nodes 1\u20135 of following quorum, Q\u2019. (Similarly, but not depicted, when Q is the second quorum there will be inbound connections to SN\u2081 through SN\u2085 from the previous quorum\u2019s last 5 nodes): first node in the quorum will open connections to nodes 2\u20136, the second node will open to nodes 3\u20137, and so on. The sixth node will open connections to nodes 7\u201310, the seventh node to 8\u201310 and 1, and so on. Additionally, once a quorum becomes the first quorum, nodes 6\u201310 each establish a connection to nodes 1\u20135 in the second quorum. This is designed to be balanced: each service node establishes outgoing connections to exactly 5 other service nodes, and is connected to by a (different) 5 service nodes. Each of these Additionally, each quorum would have some nodes that establish a connection to some of the nodes in the following quorum over which messages will be passed when a quorum has acquired the required supermajority of signatures. 4.12. Service node deregistrations \u00b6 As discussed in the Quorum Selection section, the service nodes that make up a quorum are chosen by excluding service nodes that have (or will) expire before the quorum completes its tasks. A related problem, however, is that there are unforseeable deregistrations that may occur (or may have already occurred) since the seed height. This is partially addressed by the quorum tolerance: since a quorum required only 7 of 10 votes, it can continue to function even if 3 nodes deregister. It is, however, possible (albeit extremely unlikely) that 4 or more nodes have been deregistered from the network in either quorum, either before the quorum begins or during the quorum validity period. If this occurs, a quorum member must simply refuse to sign. This can also be checked by the initiating lokid: if it fails to build a quorum of at least 7 active nodes in each quorum it can immediately return an error to the initiating wallet that the Blink service is temporarily down. The reason that we cannot add \u201csubstitute\u201d nodes in the event of deregistrations is that it would affect the validity of quorum signatures if a blockchain reorganization should happen: such a reorganization could delay the deregistration to the point that the substitute isn\u2019t actually valid anymore, thereby invalidating the Blink signature. It is tempting to at least consider substitutions for deregistrations that are past an immutable checkpoint boundary, but again this would not work: though checkpoints are distributed across the network, they are a moving target that is external to the blockchain itself. Thus determining the correct set of quorum signatures would change as checkpoints propagate the network and so verification of having the correct set of signatures would be impossible. We believe that the 7 of 10 threshold, allowing for up to three failures (including deregistrations) should be sufficient to keep Blink operational in all but extreme circumstances (such as mass Service Node deregistrations). Should this prove problematic, the recommended approach is to increase the quorum size, slightly reduce the supermajority requirement, or both. 5. Potential attacks \u00b6 While the basics of the above in normal operation are fine, there are several edge cases that need to be addressed specifically to prevent accidental conflict or deliberate attacks. 5.1. Double-spending Blink tx + non-Blink tx \u00b6 This attack would work by privately mining a block where the inputs used in a Blink transaction are spent, conducting a Blink transaction, then releasing the private block to the network after the Blink transaction has been approved. This would be a classic double spend, but because Blink transactions are 0-confirmation transactions, you don\u2019t need a 51% attack; you would just need a single block and a bit of luck. The solution to this is that Blink transactions in the mempool are stronger for consensus purposes than non-Blink transactions on the chain . That is, if a Blink-signed transaction arrives in the mempool that conflicts with (i.e. spends the same inputs as) a transaction already mined on the chain then the block containing the conflicting non-Blink transaction is no longer a valid blockchain block and must be rolled back. There is a limitation to this, however: if the conflicting block has passed an irreversible checkpoint boundary then it is instead the Blink transaction that is invalid. [6] 5.2. Double-spending Blink + Blink \u00b6 Sending two parallel Blink transactions that spend some of the same inputs at the same signing height h isn\u2019t possible: the approving service nodes by design will not sign twice for the same outputs, and to actually be accepted a Blink transaction must be signed by a supermajority of the service nodes in the (unique) signing quorum. Sending two Blink transactions at different heights, however, can be a potential issue if exploited by something I will call \u201cquorum hopping\u201d and address in the next section. 5.3. Quorum hopping \u00b6 In order to double-spend Blink transactions it is necessary to \u201cquorum hop\u201d \u2013 that is, to have your transaction signed by two independent sets of quorums. Practically speaking, that means that that you need one Blink transaction signed by Q\u2081 and Q\u2082 , and another spending the same outputs signed by Q\u2083 and Q\u2084 . [7] For the purposes of illustration, I\u2019ll continue with TX example two from Figure 2, and I\u2019ll assume the attacker has an arbitrary amount of hash power available. In order to quorum hop, the attacker needs to get signatures from Q\u2081 and Q\u2082 and signatures for another transaction spending the same outputs from Q\u2083 and Q\u2084 . The basic assurance is that while the current network is at height 1006, Q\u2084 won\u2019t sign a transaction. However, 1006 is close enough to the quorum endpoint that the attacker does get a choice between the Q\u2081/Q\u2082 pair and the Q\u2082/Q\u2083 pair: though Q\u2082/Q\u2083 is the proper quorum pair for a truthful h =1006 request, we allow him to claim h =1004 (to allow for network latency). To get a successful signing from the Q\u2083/Q\u2084 quorum pair, however, the second Blink transaction must request a signing height of at least h =1010, and the quorum won\u2019t accept such a height unless it locally sees at least h =1008. This means the attacker needs to get two new blocks on the network quickly but not too quickly: if too fast, the transaction may reach too many of the Q\u2081/Q\u2082 quorum members that the first tx signature fails. If too slow, the signed transaction broadcast from Q\u2081/Q\u2082 service nodes may reach enough Q\u2083/Q\u2084 service nodes that signing of the second transaction fails. Thus we\u2019ll assume that there is some small window for \u201cgoldilocks\u201d timing: timing that is not too fast to reach Q\u2081/Q\u2082 and not too slow to reach Q\u2083/Q\u2084 after the first transaction. The timing of the attack would go like this: Privately mine and withhold 2 blocks (heights 1007 and 1008). Initiate a Blink signing at h =1004 (thus using the Q\u2081/Q\u2082 quorum pair). Release the withheld blocks; ideally send them directly to Q\u2083/Q\u2084 quorum members. Initiate the conflicting transaction Blink signing at h =1008 (thus using Q\u2083/Q\u2084 ). If successful, nodes on the network will end up receiving two conflict Blink transactions with valid signatures. First, for a unique consensus rule, we need to pick a consensus winner, which is easy enough: we simple prefer the Blink transaction with an earlier signing height and reject the later one. [8] Second, and more important, we want to make the attack to be \u201cimpossible\u201d [9] . This is done by effectively adding a delay to Blink signing in potentially problematic case, effectively shortening the \u201cgoldilocks\u201d window to nothing. Specifically the proposed delay is as follows: when a quorum service node is asked to sign a transaction at height h , it checks the time when it received the critical block that allowed the given quorum pair associated with height h . If this critical block was received less than 5 seconds ago, it delays the Blink checks and signing until at least 5 seconds have elapsed since that critical block was was received by the given service node. For example, the critical block for a signing height of 1007 would be 1003; for 1010 it would be 1008: The whole idea here is to add enough of a delay that the Blink transaction being signed by Q\u2081/Q\u2082 has time to propagate to enough Q\u2083/Q\u2084 service nodes that they will see the double-spending attempt and thus fail to build enough signatures to Blink the transaction. 5 seconds should generally be much more than enough for reach all the quorum members, but we don\u2019t actually need it to reach all: rather it is enough to reach just a supermajority-busting minority or either Q\u2083 or Q\u2084 service nodes. A delay of up to 5-seconds is highly undesirable for a Blink transaction, of course, so it is worth considering how unlikely this delay would be under typical blockchain activity when an honest user is sending a Blink transaction. Let\u2019s suppose the user submits a transaction to sign at height h=1010 , and so quorum service nodes check when they received block h=1008 to figure out whether they need to delay. In order to trigger a delay, we need h=1008 to have been received by the service node less than 5 seconds before the signing request is received. Adding an extra couple of seconds for blocks to reach service nodes, this means we need to have found 3 (or more) blocks on the network in approximately 7 seconds. Given LOKI\u2019s 120-second block target, the probability of seeing this naturally is approximately 0.000031[^prob_7s]; even if we allowed for increased network latency to delay block transmission by 5 seconds the probability of triggering the delay is still only 0.000091. These probabilities are also worst cases conditional on using the first block in a new quorum (which itself only occurs 1/5 of the time). If we consider the probabilities for a transaction signed at h=1011 , we would need 4 network blocks received in the same timeframe: that is, 0.00000046 for a 7-second window and 0.00000188 for a 10-second window. Thus suffice it to say that the probability of an honest user accidentally hitting the delay is small. Even if they do hit it because of extremely bad luck, the only consequence is a delay of at most 5 seconds for their Blink confirmation. 5.4. Signature withholding \u00b6 The design requires the Blink quorum itself to disseminate the Blink transaction to the network. This has one potential advantage of having the transaction go out faster (service nodes are often better connected), but the more important reason is to prevent the caller from withholding the Blink transaction to cancel out a later Blink transaction. Such an attack would work as follows: Attacker constructs a Blink transaction sending funds to himself; he submits at the current height using quorums Q\u2081 and Q\u2082 . Instead of immediately transmitting the signed transaction to the network, however, he stores it. He then waits a few blocks for a height that will let him use a different quorum pair, Q\u2083 and Q\u2084 . The attacker constructs another Blink transaction sending the same outputs to an exotic car dealer who, seeing the Blink transaction on the network, hands over the keys to a brand new Italian sports car. While driving off, the attacker releases the initial Blink signatures which replaces the car payment transaction with his earlier transaction to himself, making the car payment permanently unspendable. To avoid the problem, we need to force the transaction dissemination as quickly as possible: thus mandating that the service node quorums should themselves broadcast it; this effectively means the Blink transaction will be broadcast to the network from 14\u201320 well-connected nodes. As a side effect, this broad dissemination method also ensures that Blink transactions reach all nodes very quickly. 5.5. 51% attack to reorganize the Blink quorum \u00b6 The idea behind this attack is that an attacker would submit a blink transaction then attempt to invalidate it by using a 51% attack to reorganize the blockchain far enough back as to disrupt the quorum seed, thus making the blink signatures on the transaction no longer valid. This attack is prevented by requiring a long (35-block) lag for quorum determination and not having service nodes sign a transaction if they do not see their quorum seed height as checkpoint-immutable. See Quorum selection block and checkpointingrationale for more details. 6. Future ideas \u00b6 There are myriad ways the Blink implementation could be extended and advanced; this section is laying out some of them. Note that there is no guarantee that all of these will be implemented. 6.1. Dynamic fees \u00b6 In the Fees section we currently mandate that the miner transaction fee for a Blink transaction must always be set to the \u201cnormal\u201d priority fee. This is sub-optimal: a dynamic system that sets a fee based on the blockchain activity. For example, the transaction priority (and thus the fee) could be calculated by considering the average fee and fill percentage of the 60 blocks ending 30 blocks before the Blink height to calculate a fee. The Blink portion of the fee could similarly be dynamic based on the number of recent Blink transactions on the blockchain. 6.2. Merging transactions \u00b6 Given a pair of Blink transactions on the mempool, it ought to be possible to merge them into a single transaction. For example, if Kee blinks funds to Jason and Jason reblinks those funds to Simon, it ought to be possible (at least in some situations) to merge the transactions in such a way that both can be replaced with a single merged transaction that spends all the same outputs and pays the right recipients, but is combined into a single, smaller transaction on the blockchain. The privacy components of Loki\u2019s underlying design certainly complicates the idea, but it is worth pursuing at least some research into whether and how this could be accomplished. In theory this combining could also be done for regular transactions, but starting this with Blink with its much stronger guarantees of blockchain acceptance seems safer. 6.3. Allowing different Blink supermajority levels \u00b6 In this plan we simply specify a quorum of 10 and supermajority of 7. It seems plausible, however, to let advanced users require an extra paranoid level of security by including a flag requesting a higher level of signing: for example, requiring 8 or 9 signatures per quorum. This would increase the likelihood of failures due to quorum communication issues, and would likely slightly increase the typical Blink time, but would be entirely feasible to support. One question mark around this is whether it would be a particularly valuable addition for LOKI users. On the one hand it would allow extra choice, but there is uncertainty as to whether this extra choice would actually be used. A larger concern is that the option of a \u201cmore secure\u201d mode would imply that the default 7/10 supermajority requirement is somehow less secure, despite the design (as laid out in this document) explicitly targetting building a secure system. Indeed the only security gained from a higher quorum level is higher protection again quorum ownership by an adversary. As the statistics in the Overlapping quorums rationale point out, however, this is already an extremely low risk even for someone in control of a huge portion of the network\u2019s service nodes. Thus it might be preferable to not offer such a feature explicitly to undermine that the current Blink system is already designed to be highly secure. Users who need an extra paranoid level of security will always be better off using a regular transaction and waiting for many confirmations plus service node checkpoints. 6.4. Quorum communication via mesh network \u00b6 The idea proposed above for intra-quorum communication is simple, but probably does not scale well to larger quorum (such as the 20-node quorum used for checkpoints). An alternative approach is to use a partially connected mesh network over which some SNs route messages for other SNs. This complicated the mechanism (because more node-to-node routing is required) and slightly reduces the speed, but network latency is less of a concern for checkpointing than it is for Blink transactions. 6.5. Carrying traffic over lokinet \u00b6 One aspect to consider in the future is the possibility of carrying all blink coordination traffic over lokinet rather than establishing direct public IP SN-to-SN connections. Such transmission can still be fast by using 0-hop paths within lokinet (which are effectively just encrypted direction connections). There is no particular reason that this data needs to be encrypted or hidden, but this would have some advantage for lokinet by providing cover traffic, and would let lokinet deal with any connection nuances. One technical caveat raised by lokinet devs when discussing this idea is that we would have to take steps to ensure that lokinet\u2019s connectivity parameters remain sufficiently high to not partition the network: So the idea is that snodes within a quorum are going to talk to each other. If this goes over 0-hop lokinet then their lokinet routers will have connections to one-another. This is fine. The possible issue arises because lokinet routers have a preset minimum number of connections to other routers that they want to maintain. If this minimum is low enough that it is satisfied by the quorum size then the routers may not seek out connections to other routers and, in theory, that quorum could become partitioned from the network by way of all the routers only connecting to one-another and not other routers outside their quorum. It doesn\u2019t seem super likely to happen, and is easily prevented anyway by setting min_conn_count > quorum_size , but it is technically possible without that mitigation so I figure we may as well set our desired minimum connection count for the routers higher just in case. Another possibility is to include some sort of flag to tell lokinet to not consider this a connection for the purposes of maintaining the minimum connection count. Footnotes \u00b6 This split is purely for the sake of example and not meant to be taken as a concrete plan to change the coinbase reward to these particular values. Any such change in reward structure is obviously entirely outside the purview of this document. A node that is one minute behind the network will fall to more than 2 blocks away from the proper height 0.18% of the time; with two minute lag the node will exceed 2 blocks 1.89% of the time; a thirty-second-slow node will be a problem 0.013% of the time. Since a node lagging by any of these values occurs only rarely (not consistently), the actual probability of users encountering such failures on a decently connected node should be much lower. It is possible for the quorum to return an error status indicating that the lokid should retry at a new height; it is up to the lokid whether it wants to do this or return an error to the client. This is actually a bit more complicated because new transactions can be submitted that spend the Blink transaction outputs or that include the Blink transaction outputs as a decoy. That means those transactions themselves will depend on the Blink transaction, adding further chaining. Effectively the only way to get a tx in block *h* that refers to a tx in block *h* or *h-1* is if a blockchain reorganization that dumps transactions back into the mempool happens; this typically only occurs in a 51% attack so can be considered rare enough to provide a high assurance of the link between transactions. This case is virtually impossible in normal operations, but it must still be specified and handled for completeness of consensus rules. You could hop further, of course, to *Q\u2084* and *Q\u2085*, but the attack is the same: it is just more costly to pull off. In theory there could be transactions that reference the second transaction\u2019s outputs that would also need to be ejected from the mempool. Given that the window of opportunity here is extremely small, this seems a negligible concern. In a practical sense, of course. More technically, we want the attack to be extremely difficult to carry out.","title":"Blink"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#loki-blink-design","text":"","title":"Loki Blink Design"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#metadata","text":"LIP Number : LIP-4 Title : Loki Blink [No Vote] Author : Jason Rhinelander (@jagerman) jason@loki.network Status : Draft Type : Core Created : 2019-06-06 Requires : LIP-3 (checkpointing) Source : LIP 4","title":"Metadata"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#version-history","text":"v0.9 Initial public draft.","title":"Version history"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#1-summary","text":"Blink is Loki\u2019s instant payment mechanism proposed in the original Loki whitepaper.

For the user receiving a blink transaction, the wallet will see the received amount virtually instantly (that is, as soon as it is received by the lokid and the wallet refreshes with the daemon). Moreover these funds will be instantly spendable: unlike a regular transaction there will be no lock on the received funds before they can be spent again.

Additionally, Blink transactions will not have a choice in transaction priority: since they are instantly spendable and guaranteed by the network, there would be little point in a user ever choosing anything higher than the minimum. Thus, for now, we mandate that Blink fees must always be submitted with a \u201cnormal\u201d priority transaction fee (but this is tentative and may be adjust this before final Blink release). The extra Blink fee doesn\u2019t go to anyone: rather it gets permanently destroyed as part of the transaction. We considered two alternatives here: Collecting fees and redistributing to SN over time. This would involve temporarily burning Blink fees, but keeping track of how much had been burned and continually reemitting them over a period of time as an extra rewards to Service Nodes. (For example: in every block, reduce the current pool of burned fees by 0.1% and reemit it to the service nodes that earn a reward in that block). Just burning fees. Ultimately we decided on the second approach because: It is much simpler. It is more predictable: SN rewards (for a stable number of service nodes) are known precisely. In the end, the two approaches are effectively equivalent in terms of total emission. By equivalent I am assuming that we have a specific net emission target. For simplicity, I\u2019ll just talk about the long-term 28 LOKI/block emissions, and, for the sake of example, assume that it is divided up so that service nodes get 20 LOKI/block of that; [1] the remaining 8 is foundation and miner coinbase rewards. What I mean by net emission is that if we have an average burning of 5 LOKI/block in Blink fees, then the net emission would 23 LOKI/block. But let\u2019s suppose that 25 LOKI/block is our actual desired long-run emission target. With method 1, we\u2019re emitting 28 LOKI/block: burned Blink fees are reemitted over time and so, much like regular tx fees, there is no net gain or loss. To hit the 25 LOKI/block target we\u2019d have to adjust the formula to reduce emissions to 25 LOKI/block. With method 2, where we are burning 5 LOKI/block in fees, we are generate net emissions of 23 LOKI/block; to hit the same 25 LOKI/block target, then, we would need to increase coinbase emissions by 2 LOKI/block to hit our target. Either way we arrive at the same place: net emissions of 25 LOKI/block through adjustment of the emission schedule. This was just an example, of course; our actual target could be 20 or 28 or 12 or whatever else. But with method 2, service nodes always know exactly what they will earn, while with method 1 there is more variability: large, sustained differences in the volume of Blink transactions will affect SN profitability, while in method 2 such differences will affect the overall coin emission but not the amount earned by a service node. Thus, given the simpler approach and essential equivalence between the two approaches, we decided to pursue method 2. (Of course, like anything in Loki, we can always change the design later given compelling reasons to do so!)","title":"3.3. Fees"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#4-technical-design","text":"","title":"4. Technical design"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#41-transaction-overview","text":"In a nutshell (with most of the details covered later in this document): The wallet builds a transaction and sends it to the lokid to be blinked. The lokid then looks up the Blink quorum, connects to a few nodes in this quorum, sending the transaction to them to be signed. The quorum distributes the transaction within itself, and once enough approval signatures are collected, broadcasts the transaction and signature data to the service node\u2019s p2p peers to disseminate it across the network. The lokid talking to the quorum then receives a confirmation message (with signatures) to relay to the wallet. These steps are depicted in Figure 1. Note that the diagram has been significantly simplified for illustration to show only three service nodes per quorum rather than the actual ten. In more detail: The wallet constructs a transaction. This transaction is almost like a regular transaction except that it leaves enough inputs unspent to cover both the required mining transaction fee and the Blink fee. This transaction gets send to the wallet\u2019s lokid for handling. lokid looks at the transaction, does some preliminary checks (as it would with any transaction) and additional checks related to the Blink transaction (such as having the correct transaction priority and blink fee). These checks are not strictly required for network security\u2014they will also be done by the service nodes \u2014 but can give an immediate failure response to the wallet if the node reasonably believes the transaction will fail. Assuming the preliminary checks pass, the node then uses the current blockchain height to determine the transaction\u2019s signing height, h . This h value then determines two current Blink quorums, Q and Q\u2019 (more details on quorum construction are in the Quorum selection section below). The lokid handling the transaction connects directly to 2 nodes selected randomly from each quorum and sends the transaction (plus other required details such as h ) to be signed. The receiving quorum nodes directly contacted by the initiating lokid forward the transaction details to the other quorum nodes for verification. Each service node in the two quorums performs checks on the validity of the transaction, such as ensuring that it isn\u2019t already spent, that it isn\u2019t already in the mempool, that miner and Blink fees are correctly specified, and that the requested signature height, h , h is approximately current (within 2 blocks of what the service node believes is the current height), and that the key images have not been already locked out by a previous, different Blink transaction signing. Assuming everything checks out, the service node records the transaction\u2019s key images locally (to lock them out from being signed again by this service node), signs the transaction hash with the service node private key, and sends the signature to the other quorum members. As each of the quorum members receives a supermajority of valid signatures (i.e. 7 in total) from both quorums it immediately sends out the transaction and signature details to its blockchain peers via its p2p network. If the quorum node in question is one of the nodes that was directly contacted by lokid, it additionally communicates the success back to the caller. These signed mempool transactions, however, are much stronger than a regular mempool transaction in that they can trigger a reorg or lead to rejected blocks: more details on this are covered below. In the case of detectable failure (for example, from a detected double-spend confirmed by a sufficient number of service nodes), a failure message is returned to the caller. If a failure is caused by too many quorum nodes timing out the caller is expected to itself timeout after an appropriate amount of time waiting for a response. The initiating lokid waits for success, failure, or timeout from the quorum nodes it contacted, and once received (or timed out), sends this information back to the wallet.","title":"4.1. Transaction overview"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#42-quorum-selection","text":"Quorum selection works by using the requested signing height h to deterministically select the two relevant quorums, Q and Q\u2019 . A quorum Q is determined by the 5-block range within which h falls, and Q\u2019 is the quorum for the immediately subsequent 5-block range. For example, any h value in 1000\u20131004 will yield the same Q and Q\u2019 quorums, and this Q\u2019 will be exactly the same quorum as the Q quorum for an h value in the 1005\u20131009 signing height range. In other words, Q\u2019(h=1003) and Q(h=1006) are the same quorum . All service nodes in Q and Q\u2019 refuse to sign a transaction with a requested signing height h that is more than 2 blocks behind or ahead of the service node\u2019s current blockchain height: this is to allow some tolerance for Blink transactions to succeed even if new blocks are propagating through the network during the Blink transaction signing process. This \u00b12 tolerance is designed to make the user experience better: using a node that is slightly out of sync [2] will still work fine rather than returning a Blink failure. It also avoids potential Blink failures on the part of quorum nodes: if a block happens to arrive during the actual signing process such that half of the quorum see the new block and half see the old block the quorum will still sign without issue. On the other hand the \u00b12 limit on the signing height also prevents abuse: the larger the allowed range, the more choices a malicious actor would have to pick and choose a \u201cfriendly\u201d quorum. The quorum sample itself needs to be effectively immutable, and so we propose a deterministic random sampling using a MT19937-64 random number generator seeded with the block hash 35 blocks before the first valid quorum height, h\u2080 . Thus quorum Q for height 1002 is determined by block 965 (35 blocks before the first signing height of the quorum, h\u2080 =1000), and quorum Q\u2019 is determined by block 970 (35 blocks before the first height of the second quorum, h\u2019\u2080 =1005). Moreover the sampling algorithm excludes any service nodes that are scheduled to expire before block h\u2080 +10. For validation of a Blink transaction we require a supermajority of signatures from both quorums. The point here of using the two quorums is to prevent a timing conflict where, if we had just one quorum per block (or range of blocks), then one Blink transaction could be signed by quorum Q\u2081 and another transaction spending the same keys could be signed by quorum Q\u2082 before the first transaction is broadcast to the network. By using two overlapping quorums we end up with the key images in question being locked both in the current quorum but also in the following quorum (which could come as early as the next block). Even if the next Blink transaction switches to a new quorum, the overlap ensures that it simply switching to a quorum that has already locked any key images of Blink transactions submitted in the last few blocks.","title":"4.2. Quorum selection"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#421-overlapping-quorums-rationale","text":"There are three reasons for using these two overlapping quorums. First, we want the quorum signature process to \u201creach\u201d a few blocks into the future (5\u20139 blocks ahead with 5-block quorums) to give enough time for the quorum signatures to disseminate across the network. While 5 blocks is more than would be typically required, there are some edge cases discussed in detail below that can lower this future block interval to just 2 blocks. Second, Blink processing is expected to require a substantial number of connections between service nodes; with 5-block quorums we can at least reduce the frequency with which connections need to be established as service nodes will keep their connections open for the duration of the quorum. Third, using two quorums offers considerable higher security than one quorum of twice the size for two reasons. First, each quorum is essentially a new random draw of service nodes; that means the more quorums you have over a given period of time the more random draws you do, and with more draws you get more \u201cchances\u201d to pick a compromised sample. Second, two consecutive supermajorities of quorums of half the size is considerably more secure than one supermajority of a quorum twice the size. Some numbers can help demonstrate this: suppose the network has 1000 service nodes, and a single malicious actor is in control of 25% of those service nodes. Under alternative A, we require the majority of a single quorum of 20 service nodes, and require a 70% of the service nodes\u2019 signatures. Under alternative B, we require two quorums of 10 service nodes each, again requiring 70% signatures from each quorum. Under scenario A in any given quorum the actor has a probability of 0.00000381 of having the required 70% majority. Under scenario B, the actor has a probability of 0.000000173: that is, under scenario A, the actor is about 22 times more likely to obtain control of any random quorum than any random quorum pair. Or to put it into context: in a one year span, there\u2019s about an 18% chance that this bad actor would gain quorum control for at least a single quorum under scenario A, and about a 0.9% chance that he would under scenario B. As for quorum length, if quorums lasted for one block instead of five there would be a 4.4% chance of this 25% operator having a quorum supermajority at least once under the overlapping quorum design, and a 63% chance under the single quorum design. If this adversary actually controlled an incredible 50% of the service node network it would be quite difficult to avoid a compromise: he would have quorum supermajority votes about 2% of the time under the single quorum approach, and 0.3% of the time under the overlapping quorum approach. Such an adversary would have a 95% chance of quorum ownership at least once per day with a quorum of 20, and a 35% chance per day with overlapping quorums. It is worth pointing out, in passing, that these probabilities are countered by the economic design of Loki: even if such adversaries existed, they would have a strong financial incentive to ensure that the network is not compromised as such a compromise would likely have a significant negative impact on their own holdings, which are heavily invested and locked into service node stakes. There is, of course, some desirable statistical properties of making a quorum longer : if quorums changed on a 10 block cycle you\u2019d cut the probability of compromise by nearly half (to 0.45% in the overlapping case). This gain isn\u2019t huge, though; moreover the longer the quorum becomes the more complications can arise from service node deregistrations, and the more time you allow for coordination between service node operators looking to cheat the system. Instead, if we wanted to further increase the security of Blink transactions, a preferable approach would be to use a triple quorum. It could also be possible to enable an opt-in triple quorum, at a higher fee, to allow users to send with a paranoid level of assurance. (This is now, however, part of the current Blink plan.)","title":"4.2.1. Overlapping quorums rationale"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#422-quorum-selection-block-and-checkpointing-rationale","text":"Using a lag of 30 blocks for quorum determination was chosen to interact with Loki checkpointing. Unlike checkpointing and deregistration quorums, a change in Blink quorums would be highly undesirable as the validity of the Blink signature would no longer hold. Thus we want to use a height from the blockchain that is sufficiently far back as to be highly likely to be made immutable via checkpointing. By basing the quorum on h\u2080 -30 we give ample time for checkpointing even if 2-3 checkpoints have been missed. For example, if blinking at height 1000 then Q\u2019 begins at 1005, which means the relevant block for determination of Q\u2019 is 975. Checkpointing normally occurs every 4 blocks with immutability occurring after 3 checkpoints. Thus in typical times it can be up to 4 blocks since the last checkpoint quorum, which itself establishes a checkpoint on a block 4 blocks earlier. Allowing up to 2 blocks for the quorum to vote and disseminate the checkpoint to the network this means the first checkpoint is usually between 4 and 10 blocks ago, the second is 8-14 blocks ago, and the third, immutable checkpoint is 12-18 blocks ago. If one of these checkpoints were missed (for example because of a quorum failure) then the immutable checkpoint could be 16-22 blocks ago; and if three were missed, up to 30 blocks ago. Thus the h\u2080 -35 rule establishes that both quorum selections are established by a block at least 30 blocks in the past, which allows Blink to tolerate up to 3 missing checkpoints. To further secure Blink transactions we further require that the quorum seed heights are checkpoint-immutable: both the initiating lokid and the quorum service nodes will verify that the quorum seed height is in fact checkpointed, refusing to sign (and thus failing the Blink if enough fail to see the required checkpoints) if it is not. This ensures that Blink transactions are secure by preferring to fail a Blink signature rather than include one that has any chance of being invalidated by a block reorganization.","title":"4.2.2.

We can think about a few different cases: Submitting the blink transaction normally at the known height (1002). Thus we get Q = Q\u2081 and Q\u2019 = Q\u2082 for the two quorums. The initiating lokid contacts a random service node q from Q\u2081 , passes along the transaction, and waits for a reply from q . q in turn communicates with its quorum peers and the subsequent quorum ( Q\u2082 ) to build the required set of signatures. Once the required signatures are accumulated the transaction is released by the quorum service nodes to their peers. The Blink TX is broadcast to the network. Because a majority of Q\u2082 service nodes signed it and will not resign the same key images, the earliest possible Blink height to spend the same key images is 1010, which can be used by a cheating lokid at network block 1008 at the earliest. Submitting slightly behind the network (1000 or 1001). This could happen, for instance, because there have been two recent blocks that the local lokid has not synchronized yet. Generally everything here works as above: the service nodes at height 1002 will still sign the block (assuming the transaction itself is valid) because the requested signature height is within 2 of their current height. Submitting slightly ahead of the network (1003 or 1004). This could happen, for instance, if the local node is close to a very lucky pool that has just discovered a couple blocks that haven\u2019t disseminated across the network yet. Again, this is handled just like the above: even though the service nodes haven\u2019t yet seen a block newer than 1002 it still satisfies the within-2 rule and so they will still sign (assuming the transaction is valid). Submitting well behind or well ahead of the network (999 or lower, or 1005 or higher). In this case the quorum will not accumulate enough signatures because the within-2 requirement is violated. In this case a failure gets returned to the initiating lokid. [3] The first three (accepted) cases above all result in the earliest block a cheater could submit to being 1008 (i.e. abusing the within-2 rule to submit a h=1010 block), giving a worst case of at least 4 blocks needing to be transmitted to the network before a duplicate Blink could be submitted; since Blink dissemination is high-priority this should result in a high level of assuredness that a Blink double-spend cannot be performed in this scenario.","title":"4.3.1.

We want this resubmission to succeed even if it goes to the same quorum, as it makes the Blink process more robust to network synchronization issues.

Since failures are possible for multiple reasons, however, it does not block the key images of a transaction that it refused to sign. It is possible, however, for a transaction to fail to be signed by a supermajority while still being signed by a superminority (that is, by enough other nodes to prevent a supermajority). This case is expected to be rare: the criteria for service node disagreement is small: effectively you would need (roughly) half of the service nodes to see something wrong with the transaction. It is not impossible, however: if a regular transaction spending the same key images is mined and the block transmitted in the middle of signing the blink could fail. The user-facing problem that could arise here is that the transaction that gets signed includes multiple key images, only some of which are ineligible. The service nodes that signed the transaction, however, end up locking all of the key images for the duration of the quorum ( i.e. the next 4\u20139 blocks), so even once the user wallet sees the updated chain a new transaction might end up trying to blink using an input that is temporarily non-blinkable (note that it will still be regularly minable since the Blink was not transmitted due to the quorum failure). This case seems rare: it would require a legitimate user spending regular transactions and blinking at the same time from different wallets. It\u2019s possible, of course, but given the rarity and the relatively minor consequence (not being able to Blink those outputs for 10\u201320 minutes) for now we will simple leave this as a known limitation.","title":"4.5.

Instead this metadata is shared and synchronized between nodes from the time when a Blink transaction enters the mempool until the transaction is mined and secured behind an immutable Loki checkpoint boundary. An incoming Blink transaction in the mempool will also be transmitted with the Blink height and the verifiable Blink signatures at which the transaction was signed. Based on this, a loki node receiving a blink transaction will perform multiple actions: Verify that the Blink signatures are the correct signers for the given height, and that the signatures are valid (and if not reject the Blink transaction). Check to see if any of the key images were spent in or before the last irreversible checkpoint block: if so, reject the Blink transaction. Check to see if the mempool already contains any Blink transactions that have a higher priority (i.e. lower height) than the incoming transactions, and if so, refuse the incoming transactions. (This shouldn\u2019t be possible, but is included as a safeguard to maintain consensus). Check the current chain back to the last irreversible checkpoint: if any blocks contain any transactions that spend any of the key images in the new Blink transaction then roll back the chain as much as needed to remove those transactions from the blockchain, re-adding any rolled back transactions into the mempool (as occurs already with any reorg). Reject any non-Blink transaction from the mempool that spend the same key images as the new Blink transaction (if we just rolled back then this means immediately rejecting the conflicting transactions). Reject any Blink transactions from the mempool that spend the same key images but have a lower priority (i.e. higher height) than the new Blink transaction. This should not be possible in general, but needs to be specified anyway to avoid a consensus failure (as with the mirrored check above). Note that this actual removal could cascade if there are other transactions referencing the removed Blink transaction. Another difference with Blink transactions is that they should not be subject to the existing 2-week mempool transaction timeout. We don\u2019t want someone to be able to submit a low-priority Blink transaction while the network is flooded with higher priority transactions and be able to wait out the transaction until timeout. As long as Blink transactions stay in the mempool until mined all an attacker can do is delay the transaction from being mined, but cannot cause it to be dropped no matter how long he prevents mining. In the unlikely event of a bug that makes a Blink transaction inadmissible to the blockchain for some unforeseen reason, this approach will keep the transaction alive indefinitely until the bug can be addressed. [4] Second, Blink transactions need to be more actively propagated across the network than current transactions. Currently the mempool is not actively synchronized across nodes; instead new transactions are simply broadcast to all connected peers when received. A new node, a node that was temporarily down when the transaction propagated across the network, or a node that has had its mempool manually flushed does not receive existing mempool transactions from peers if it misses it the first time. This needs to change for Blink transactions: when a p2p connection is established we need each peer to send the other a list of any pending Blink transaction details it doesn\u2019t already have. Effectively we need Blink transactions in the mempool to become first-class synchronization objects, just like blocks. Finally, synchronized Blink transactions may not be (and do not need to be) identical across the network in terms of attached quorum signatures: it is entirely possible for two nodes to receive a different set of 14 signatures: so long as all are valid for the quorum","title":"4.6.

Quick turn-around re-blinking breaks that with the current ring signature selection in two ways: First, a Blink transaction that enters the mempool that includes a mempool Blink transaction in its ring signature provides a perfect link between the transactions because currently only blockchain transactions but not mempool transactions are ever included in a ring signature. Even if you don\u2019t have the mempool history you can still infer likely links between Blink transactions that are very close together (i.e. within a small number of blocks). As outputs in the same block (or within a couple blocks) are highly unlikely to occur naturally, seeing such transactions in the mempool give a high probability that the transactions are linked. [5] To get around this problem, we will need to update the ring signature construction to be able to select from both existing blockchain transactions and Blink transactions in the mempool for both Blink transactions and regular transactions . (This of course imposes additional mempool ordering constraints to those discussed in the blockchain section as ordering also applies to non-Blink transactions using mempool decoys.) Further investigation will be needed to determine a good selection probability (and will likely need tweaking in future releases), but we will aim to be on the side of having too high a probability: using too low a probability is much worse as it would make Blink transactions still stand out (albeit imperfectly). Potentially including mempool Blink transactions in normal transaction ring signatures is important as well: because a Blink transaction is instantly spendable, a non-Blink transaction including a recent Blink transaction would similarly link the outputs together. Thus we potentially include Blink dummy transactions in all transactions (which has the separate advantage of simplifying the code: building a Blink transaction and building a regular transaction will be identical).","title":"4.9.

While this is manageable for those applications it is not going to be sufficiently scalable for Blink quorum voting. Instead part of the Blink development will be to build a direct communication layer where service nodes connect directly to one another for quorum purposes. The initial plan is for quorum SNs to communicate directly with each (using the SN public IP being added in #622 ). This communication layer will also be designed to handle quorum traffic for service node deregistration and allow faster and more efficient communication in those scenarios as well. The specific implementation details will be developed further during the Blink implementation; the current plan is to create a relatively simple SN-to-SN protocol using ZMQ (which is already a loki core dependency) over which quorum members communicate, and over which the initiating lokid contacts quorum service nodes to begin the Blink signing process. The initial approach here is to use a fully-connected quorum: 9 open connections, roughly half inbound and half outbound, for each SN, held open (and reestablished upon disconnection) for the duration of the Blink quorum validity. As a simple fully connected approach, the following table shows node-to-node connections within a quorum: where \u201co\u201d indicates that the row node establishes an outgoing connection to the column node and \u201ci\u201d indicates that the row node receives an incoming connection from the column node. Additionally once the depicted quorum Q becomes the first quorum, nodes 6\u201310 establish outgoing connections to nodes 1\u20135 of following quorum, Q\u2019. (Similarly, but not depicted, when Q is the second quorum there will be inbound connections to SN\u2081 through SN\u2085 from the previous quorum\u2019s last 5 nodes): first node in the quorum will open connections to nodes 2\u20136, the second node will open to nodes 3\u20137, and so on. The sixth node will open connections to nodes 7\u201310, the seventh node to 8\u201310 and 1, and so on. Additionally, once a quorum becomes the first quorum, nodes 6\u201310 each establish a connection to nodes 1\u20135 in the second quorum. This is designed to be balanced: each service node establishes outgoing connections to exactly 5 other service nodes, and is connected to by a (different) 5 service nodes. Each of these Additionally, each quorum would have some nodes that establish a connection to some of the nodes in the following quorum over which messages will be passed when a quorum has acquired the required supermajority of signatures.","title":"4.11.

A related problem, however, is that there are unforseeable deregistrations that may occur (or may have already occurred) since the seed height. This is partially addressed by the quorum tolerance: since a quorum required only 7 of 10 votes, it can continue to function even if 3 nodes deregister. It is, however, possible (albeit extremely unlikely) that 4 or more nodes have been deregistered from the network in either quorum, either before the quorum begins or during the quorum validity period. If this occurs, a quorum member must simply refuse to sign. This can also be checked by the initiating lokid: if it fails to build a quorum of at least 7 active nodes in each quorum it can immediately return an error to the initiating wallet that the Blink service is temporarily down. The reason that we cannot add \u201csubstitute\u201d nodes in the event of deregistrations is that it would affect the validity of quorum signatures if a blockchain reorganization should happen: such a reorganization could delay the deregistration to the point that the substitute isn\u2019t actually valid anymore, thereby invalidating the Blink signature. It is tempting to at least consider substitutions for deregistrations that are past an immutable checkpoint boundary, but again this would not work: though checkpoints are distributed across the network, they are a moving target that is external to the blockchain itself. Thus determining the correct set of quorum signatures would change as checkpoints propagate the network and so verification of having the correct set of signatures would be impossible. We believe that the 7 of 10 threshold, allowing for up to three failures (including deregistrations) should be sufficient to keep Blink operational in all but extreme circumstances (such as mass Service Node deregistrations). Should this prove problematic, the recommended approach is to increase the quorum size, slightly reduce the supermajority requirement, or both.","title":"4.12.

Double-spending Blink + Blink"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#53-quorum-hopping","text":"In order to double-spend Blink transactions it is necessary to \u201cquorum hop\u201d \u2013 that is, to have your transaction signed by two independent sets of quorums. Practically speaking, that means that that you need one Blink transaction signed by Q\u2081 and Q\u2082 , and another spending the same outputs signed by Q\u2083 and Q\u2084 . [7] For the purposes of illustration, I\u2019ll continue with TX example two from Figure 2, and I\u2019ll assume the attacker has an arbitrary amount of hash power available. In order to quorum hop, the attacker needs to get signatures from Q\u2081 and Q\u2082 and signatures for another transaction spending the same outputs from Q\u2083 and Q\u2084 . The basic assurance is that while the current network is at height 1006, Q\u2084 won\u2019t sign a transaction. However, 1006 is close enough to the quorum endpoint that the attacker does get a choice between the Q\u2081/Q\u2082 pair and the Q\u2082/Q\u2083 pair: though Q\u2082/Q\u2083 is the proper quorum pair for a truthful h =1006 request, we allow him to claim h =1004 (to allow for network latency). To get a successful signing from the Q\u2083/Q\u2084 quorum pair, however, the second Blink transaction must request a signing height of at least h =1010, and the quorum won\u2019t accept such a height unless it locally sees at least h =1008. This means the attacker needs to get two new blocks on the network quickly but not too quickly: if too fast, the transaction may reach too many of the Q\u2081/Q\u2082 quorum members that the first tx signature fails. If too slow, the signed transaction broadcast from Q\u2081/Q\u2082 service nodes may reach enough Q\u2083/Q\u2084 service nodes that signing of the second transaction fails. Thus we\u2019ll assume that there is some small window for \u201cgoldilocks\u201d timing: timing that is not too fast to reach Q\u2081/Q\u2082 and not too slow to reach Q\u2083/Q\u2084 after the first transaction. The timing of the attack would go like this: Privately mine and withhold 2 blocks (heights 1007 and 1008). Initiate a Blink signing at h =1004 (thus using the Q\u2081/Q\u2082 quorum pair). Release the withheld blocks; ideally send them directly to Q\u2083/Q\u2084 quorum members. Initiate the conflicting transaction Blink signing at h =1008 (thus using Q\u2083/Q\u2084 ). If successful, nodes on the network will end up receiving two conflict Blink transactions with valid signatures. First, for a unique consensus rule, we need to pick a consensus winner, which is easy enough: we simple prefer the Blink transaction with an earlier signing height and reject the later one. [8] Second, and more important, we want to make the attack to be \u201cimpossible\u201d [9] . This is done by effectively adding a delay to Blink signing in potentially problematic case, effectively shortening the \u201cgoldilocks\u201d window to nothing. Specifically the proposed delay is as follows: when a quorum service node is asked to sign a transaction at height h , it checks the time when it received the critical block that allowed the given quorum pair associated with height h . If this critical block was received less than 5 seconds ago, it delays the Blink checks and signing until at least 5 seconds have elapsed since that critical block was was received by the given service node. For example, the critical block for a signing height of 1007 would be 1003; for 1010 it would be 1008: The whole idea here is to add enough of a delay that the Blink transaction being signed by Q\u2081/Q\u2082 has time to propagate to enough Q\u2083/Q\u2084 service nodes that they will see the double-spending attempt and thus fail to build enough signatures to Blink the transaction. 5 seconds should generally be much more than enough for reach all the quorum members, but we don\u2019t actually need it to reach all: rather it is enough to reach just a supermajority-busting minority or either Q\u2083 or Q\u2084 service nodes. A delay of up to 5-seconds is highly undesirable for a Blink transaction, of course, so it is worth considering how unlikely this delay would be under typical blockchain activity when an honest user is sending a Blink transaction. Let\u2019s suppose the user submits a transaction to sign at height h=1010 , and so quorum service nodes check when they received block h=1008 to figure out whether they need to delay. In order to trigger a delay, we need h=1008 to have been received by the service node less than 5 seconds before the signing request is received. Adding an extra couple of seconds for blocks to reach service nodes, this means we need to have found 3 (or more) blocks on the network in approximately 7 seconds. Given LOKI\u2019s 120-second block target, the probability of seeing this naturally is approximately 0.000031[^prob_7s]; even if we allowed for increased network latency to delay block transmission by 5 seconds the probability of triggering the delay is still only 0.000091. These probabilities are also worst cases conditional on using the first block in a new quorum (which itself only occurs 1/5 of the time). If we consider the probabilities for a transaction signed at h=1011 , we would need 4 network blocks received in the same timeframe: that is, 0.00000046 for a 7-second window and 0.00000188 for a 10-second window. Thus suffice it to say that the probability of an honest user accidentally hitting the delay is small. Even if they do hit it because of extremely bad luck, the only consequence is a delay of at most 5 seconds for their Blink confirmation.","title":"5.3. Quorum hopping"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#54-signature-withholding","text":"The design requires the Blink quorum itself to disseminate the Blink transaction to the network. This has one potential advantage of having the transaction go out faster (service nodes are often better connected), but the more important reason is to prevent the caller from withholding the Blink transaction to cancel out a later Blink transaction. Such an attack would work as follows: Attacker constructs a Blink transaction sending funds to himself; he submits at the current height using quorums Q\u2081 and Q\u2082 . Instead of immediately transmitting the signed transaction to the network, however, he stores it. He then waits a few blocks for a height that will let him use a different quorum pair, Q\u2083 and Q\u2084 . The attacker constructs another Blink transaction sending the same outputs to an exotic car dealer who, seeing the Blink transaction on the network, hands over the keys to a brand new Italian sports car. While driving off, the attacker releases the initial Blink signatures which replaces the car payment transaction with his earlier transaction to himself, making the car payment permanently unspendable. To avoid the problem, we need to force the transaction dissemination as quickly as possible: thus mandating that the service node quorums should themselves broadcast it; this effectively means the Blink transaction will be broadcast to the network from 14\u201320 well-connected nodes. As a side effect, this broad dissemination method also ensures that Blink transactions reach all nodes very quickly.","title":"5.4.

This is sub-optimal: a dynamic system that sets a fee based on the blockchain activity. For example, the transaction priority (and thus the fee) could be calculated by considering the average fee and fill percentage of the 60 blocks ending 30 blocks before the Blink height to calculate a fee. The Blink portion of the fee could similarly be dynamic based on the number of recent Blink transactions on the blockchain.","title":"6.1.

For example, if Kee blinks funds to Jason and Jason reblinks those funds to Simon, it ought to be possible (at least in some situations) to merge the transactions in such a way that both can be replaced with a single merged transaction that spends all the same outputs and pays the right recipients, but is combined into a single, smaller transaction on the blockchain. The privacy components of Loki\u2019s underlying design certainly complicates the idea, but it is worth pursuing at least some research into whether and how this could be accomplished. In theory this combining could also be done for regular transactions, but starting this with Blink with its much stronger guarantees of blockchain acceptance seems safer.","title":"6.2. Merging transactions"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#63-allowing-different-blink-supermajority-levels","text":"In this plan we simply specify a quorum of 10 and supermajority of 7. It seems plausible, however, to let advanced users require an extra paranoid level of security by including a flag requesting a higher level of signing: for example, requiring 8 or 9 signatures per quorum. This would increase the likelihood of failures due to quorum communication issues, and would likely slightly increase the typical Blink time, but would be entirely feasible to support. One question mark around this is whether it would be a particularly valuable addition for LOKI users. On the one hand it would allow extra choice, but there is uncertainty as to whether this extra choice would actually be used. A larger concern is that the option of a \u201cmore secure\u201d mode would imply that the default 7/10 supermajority requirement is somehow less secure, despite the design (as laid out in this document) explicitly targetting building a secure system. Indeed the only security gained from a higher quorum level is higher protection again quorum ownership by an adversary. As the statistics in the Overlapping quorums rationale point out, however, this is already an extremely low risk even for someone in control of a huge portion of the network\u2019s service nodes. Thus it might be preferable to not offer such a feature explicitly to undermine that the current Blink system is already designed to be highly secure. Users who need an extra paranoid level of security will always be better off using a regular transaction and waiting for many confirmations plus service node checkpoints.","title":"6.3.

An alternative approach is to use a partially connected mesh network over which some SNs route messages for other SNs. This complicated the mechanism (because more node-to-node routing is required) and slightly reduces the speed, but network latency is less of a concern for checkpointing than it is for Blink transactions.","title":"6.4. Quorum communication via mesh network"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#65-carrying-traffic-over-lokinet","text":"One aspect to consider in the future is the possibility of carrying all blink coordination traffic over lokinet rather than establishing direct public IP SN-to-SN connections. Such transmission can still be fast by using 0-hop paths within lokinet (which are effectively just encrypted direction connections). There is no particular reason that this data needs to be encrypted or hidden, but this would have some advantage for lokinet by providing cover traffic, and would let lokinet deal with any connection nuances. One technical caveat raised by lokinet devs when discussing this idea is that we would have to take steps to ensure that lokinet\u2019s connectivity parameters remain sufficiently high to not partition the network: So the idea is that snodes within a quorum are going to talk to each other. If this goes over 0-hop lokinet then their lokinet routers will have connections to one-another. This is fine. The possible issue arises because lokinet routers have a preset minimum number of connections to other routers that they want to maintain. If this minimum is low enough that it is satisfied by the quorum size then the routers may not seek out connections to other routers and, in theory, that quorum could become partitioned from the network by way of all the routers only connecting to one-another and not other routers outside their quorum. It doesn\u2019t seem super likely to happen, and is easily prevented anyway by setting min_conn_count > quorum_size , but it is technically possible without that mitigation so I figure we may as well set our desired minimum connection count for the routers higher just in case. Another possibility is to include some sort of flag to tell lokinet to not consider this a connection for the purposes of maintaining the minimum connection count.","title":"6.5. Carrying traffic over lokinet"},{"location":"LokiServices/Blink/#footnotes","text":"This split is purely for the sake of example and not meant to be taken as a concrete plan to change the coinbase reward to these particular values. Any such change in reward structure is obviously entirely outside the purview of this document. A node that is one minute behind the network will fall to more than 2 blocks away from the proper height 0.18% of the time; with two minute lag the node will exceed 2 blocks 1.89% of the time; a thirty-second-slow node will be a problem 0.013% of the time. Since a node lagging by any of these values occurs only rarely (not consistently), the actual probability of users encountering such failures on a decently connected node should be much lower. It is possible for the quorum to return an error status indicating that the lokid should retry at a new height; it is up to the lokid whether it wants to do this or return an error to the client. This is actually a bit more complicated because new transactions can be submitted that spend the Blink transaction outputs or that include the Blink transaction outputs as a decoy. That means those transactions themselves will depend on the Blink transaction, adding further chaining. Effectively the only way to get a tx in block *h* that refers to a tx in block *h* or *h-1* is if a blockchain reorganization that dumps transactions back into the mempool happens; this typically only occurs in a 51% attack so can be considered rare enough to provide a high assurance of the link between transactions. This case is virtually impossible in normal operations, but it must still be specified and handled for completeness of consensus rules. You could hop further, of course, to *Q\u2084* and *Q\u2085*, but the attack is the same: it is just more costly to pull off. In theory there could be transactions that reference the second transaction\u2019s outputs that would also need to be ejected from the mempool. Given that the window of opportunity here is extremely small, this seems a negligible concern. In a practical sense, of course. More technically, we want the attack to be extremely difficult to carry out.","title":"Footnotes"},{"location":"LokiServices/LokiServicesOverview/","text":"Loki Services Overview \u00b6 Loki Services are built upon the protocol level of the Loki network.

End-to-end encrypted messaging applications that provide a platform for users to send messages without revealing their contents already exist, however they rely on centralised servers that can be targeted, blocked and shut down. These centralised service models present a high-risk for the anonymity of communicating parties, as they often require the user to register a phone number or other identifying information and connect directly via the IP address of the user. This information could be extracted from servers through data leaks or legal processes and used against the user. Leveraging the Service Nodes architecture on the Loki network, we can deliver a service similar to popular centralised encrypted messaging apps, such as Signal, with a higher degree of privacy and censorship resistance. Download Links \u00b6 Head over to the Loki Get Started Page to get your Loki Messenger download Links: Loki Get Started Messenger Routing \u00b6 Message routing on the Loki network changes depending on whether the receiving user is online or offline. When both users are online, higher bandwidth communications can take place due to the fact that messages do not need to be stored on the Service Nodes . In Loki, a public key acts both as long-term encryption key and a routing address. In the most simple case, this key should be exchanged out-of-band to ensure protection against a man-in-the-middle attack. Such an exchange should take place either in person or through another secure mode of exchange. Online Messaging \u00b6 Once Alice knows Bobs public key, she assumes he is online and tries to create a path to him. Alice does this by querying the DHT of any Service Node and obtains any introduction set that corresponds with Bobs public key. In LLARP, introduction sets list the introducers that each user maintains. It is through these introducers that paths can be established. With Bobs introducer, Alice now chooses three random Service Nodes to act as intermediary hops between her origin and her destination (Bobs introducer). A path has now been established, through which Alice and Bob can transmit messages. If correctly authenticated, and using OTR , Alice and Bob can now communicate while maintaining a high-level of privacy. Offline Messaging \u00b6 If Alice fails to receive a response from Bob, she can then initiate the offline messaging process. Offline routing uses a modified version of Postal Services over Swarm (PSS) . Swarms are logical groupings of Service Nodes , based both on their public keys and the hash of the block that their staking transaction first appeared in. Each swarm has a swarmID and consists of nine nodes. To send a message to Bob, Alice can use his public key to calculate which swarm Bob belongs to. With this information, Alice can anonymously route a message through the network to a random Service Nodes in that swarm. When a Service Nodes receives a unique message destined for its swarm, it must distribute that message to the other eight nodes in the swarm. All nodes are additionally required to store messages for their allocated Time-to-live (TTL). When Bob comes online, he can query any two nodes in his swarm for messages he can decrypt. Offline messaging is protected from spamming with a small proof-of-work that is attached to each message. Messenger Encryption and Authentication \u00b6 Once a message chain is established, Loki Messenger enforces Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) and Deniable Authentication (DA). PFS and DA are key concepts of the Off The Record (OTR) messaging protocol. Centralised services, such as Signal and WhatsApp, use off the existing Tox protocol, which is a distributed, peer-to-peer instant messaging protocol that uses the highly audited NaCl library . PFS enables resistance from attacks where a long-term key is exposed. A new shared encryption key is used for each session, so if a single session key is revealed, the whole message chain is not compromised. If a third-party wanted to break the encryption of a message chain they would need to obtain the keys for every individual session. PFS ensures that Loki Messenger is extremely difficult to compromise when compared to existing methods, such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption, where only one long-term key pair is required to compromise the whole message chain. DA refers to the ability for two parties to prove to each other that they are the sender of each new message. However, a third-party cannot ascertain who the true sender of any message is. When using DA, Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are published after each session, allowing third-parties to plausibly create messages that appear as if they originate from the senders public address. When correctly implemented, it is impossible for any third-party to prove that a sender of a specific message was the actual sender. User Authentication \u00b6 Authentication of users is important to ensure protection against man-in-the-middle attacks. For example, if Bob is expecting a message from Alice but does not yet know what her public key is, then a third-party (Eve), could send a message to Bob pretending to be Alice. This is why users should authenticate each other before sharing personal information. Like Pidgin and other OTR messaging services, Loki Messenger uses Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication. Users have multiple options for the establishment of a PSK. They can establish a key out-of-band, or alternatively, they can agree on a PSK over Loki Messenger by 9 asking the other a question which no third-party would know the answer. Loki will implement PSK authentication based on a modified version of the Pidgin encryption authentication plugin.","title":"Messenger"},{"location":"LokiServices/Messenger/#loki-messenger","text":"The first Loki service to has been developed and deployed on the Loki network is a decentralised, end-to-end encrypted private messaging application called Loki Messenger.

LLARP is built specifically to run on top of the Loki Service Nodes network and all LLARP optimisations consider this architecture. To understand the goals of LLARP, it is best to conduct an analysis of existing routing protocols and consider how LLARP improves upon them. LLARP operates without the need to make use of directory authorities and, instead, relies on a DHT built from blockchain staking transactions, which allows Service Nodes to act as routers in the network. Bandwidth is not monitored or recorded in the DHT. Instead, bandwidth measurement and triage result from swarms that assess each node and make a judgement on the nodes ability to provide appropriate bandwidth to the network. In the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model), LLARP only attempts to provide an anonymous network layer. This means that it supports a larger range of internet protocols and it also minimises the overhead for storing file descriptors should exit nodes pass through User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic. Additionally, LLARP opts for packet-switched based routing instead of tunnel-based routing, allowing for better load balancing and redundancy across the network. End users of Lokinet are not expected (or even allowed) to route packets, this means that Lokinet exposes itself to a much lower attack surface for a Sybil attack due to the significant capital outlay required to begin Service Nodes operation. The Onion Router (Tor) \u00b6 In recent years, Tor has been the most popular anonymous mixnet. The Tor network maintains a high-level of censorship resistance and has proved a valuable tool for preserving internet privacy. However,Tor is not a decentralised network as much as it is a hierarchical one. Tor is reliant on a group of directory authorities which are centralised servers operated by a group of volunteers close to the Tor Foundation . These directory authorities perform two main functions. Firstly, they act as trusted reporters on the state of nodes in the network. When a Tor user (or relay) connects to the network for the first time they can connect to one of ten hard-coded directory authorities. These directory authorities provide the user or relay with a file called the consensus. This file provides a list of all of the relays, guard nodes, and exit nodes currently in operation (excluding bridges) on the Tor network. Secondly, the directory authorities also measure the bandwidth that each relay can provide to the network. They use this information to triage relays into categories, deciding whether nodes can operate as relays, guard nodes, or exit nodes. Tor has potential problems with Centralisation \u00b6 This high level of centralisation creates points of failure that leaves Tor vulnerable. In 2014, Tor received information of a credible threat to take down the directory authority servers . If the directory authorities in the United States and either Germany or the Netherlands were to be shut down, that would be enough to shut down five of the ten directory authority servers. This would result in a highly unstable Tor network, with new relays being greatly diminished in their ability to interact with the network. Methods of communication in Tor are also limited, as Tor only allows communication overTCP. IP over Tor is possible, but it lacks support for UDP based protocols (such as VoIP). Invisible Internet Project (I2P) \u00b6 I2P takes a different approach to mixnet architecture, maintaining a higher level of trust agility by referring to a Distributed Hashing Table (DHT) to ascertain the network state instead of trusted directory authorities [15]. I2P also allows for both TCP and UDP traffic, supporting a larger scope of protocol interactions. However, I2P has not had a steady development process and over time it has accumulated technical debt, specifically in its cryptography usage. I2P uses 2048 bit ElGamal, which makes encryption and decryption slow in contrast to elliptic curve operations. While plans to migrate away from ElGamal exist in the I2P roadmap, progress has been slow. I2P has a lack of formal exit node support. \u00b6 Additionally, I2P lacks formal support for exit nodes , meaning the majority of traffic on the network is accessing internally hosted websites, called Eepsites. This has greatly reduced the ability for the I2P network to reach users whose main purpose for using anonymising networks is to access the wider internet. Furthermore, the manner in which I2P is built means that the majority of users that connect to the network also become routers, which is problematic as the resulting network often lacks sufficient bandwidth to be able to build fast paths. Network speeds in mixnets are bottlenecked by the least capable node in each circuit, and as a result of low-performance users becoming relays in I2P, a reduction in overall performance is seen. How does Tor compare with I2P \u00b6 Finally, I2P differs from Tor in that it offers a packet-switched (rather than circuit-switched) network. Instead of establishing a single longer-term tunnel which all traffic travels through, I2P establishes multiple paths that each packet being communicated can use to use to take a different route through the network. This gives I2P the ability to transparently route around network congestion and node failures. Cheap Node Attack \u00b6 Both I2P and Tor have not fully mitigated Sybil attacks. A sufficiently motivated attacker that has enough time and capital to buy large amounts of relays can perform temporal analysis which undermines user privacy. The effectiveness of this analysis increases the more exit nodes, relays and guard nodes the attacker operates . Tor and I2P are operated entirely by volunteers that donate both their time and money to the operation of nodes. We surmise that a network constructed from financial incentives rather than altruism can achieve a greater resilience against attacks, while providing a more reliable service.","title":"LLARP"},{"location":"Lokinet/LLARP/#low-latency-anonymous-routing-protocol-llarp","text":"Underlying all applications for Service Nodes is an anonymous routing protocol, which defines the way each Service Node communicates with its peers.

Furthermore, the manner in which I2P is built means that the majority of users that connect to the network also become routers, which is problematic as the resulting network often lacks sufficient bandwidth to be able to build fast paths. Network speeds in mixnets are bottlenecked by the least capable node in each circuit, and as a result of low-performance users becoming relays in I2P, a reduction in overall performance is seen.","title":"I2P has a lack of formal exit node support."},{"location":"Lokinet/LLARP/#how-does-tor-compare-with-i2p","text":"Finally, I2P differs from Tor in that it offers a packet-switched (rather than circuit-switched) network.

Statically over the course of running a Service Node you are likely to run into a few users who abuse their anonymity to send or receive information that may be explicitly malicious, therefor it is important that we discuss the legal implications of this malicious traffic. In most countries Exit nodes are viewed in much the same way as ISP's are, that is that they are usually classed as data transmitters, which makes them exempt from criminal or civil liability based on the data they transmit. This means they are also covered by exceptions in the EUCD and DMCA laws which stipulate content regulation on the internet in the US and Europe respectively. Despite this its important to consider that unlike ISP's exit node operators usually do not have large legal teams and a budget to fight prosecutions in court. Although a legal suit has never been brought against a Tor exit node operator, these are risks that each operator must control for. For this reason you should always check the laws of the relevant country you are operating your Service Node out of. If you run into legal challenges we recommend contacting the EFF who may be interested in hearing a case of Exit Node prosecution. Although all relevant information, it still stands as likely the most contact you are going to receive as you run an exit node is with your ISP or VPS provider who is likely to forward DMCA takedown notices, or abuse requests to the email address you used to sign up with. Disclaimer \u00b6 The Loki foundation or the writers of this guide are not responsible for any legal implications you may face because you operate a Loki Service Node. Email Templates \u00b6 If you decided to run a Service Node with exit functionality there are a couple of common abuse emails you will run into, so its a good idea to reduce the time spent answering emails to use some available templates. Copyright infringement Email Response \u00b6 European ISP Dear [ISP]: Thank you for forwarding me the notice you received from [copyright claimant] regarding [content]. I would like to assure you that I am not hosting the claimed infringing materials, and furthermore, both the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's (\"DMCA\") and the European Union Copyright Directive (\u201cEUCD\u201d) safe harbors likely protect you from liability arising from this complaint. The notice is likely based upon misunderstandings about the law and about some of the software I run. As you may know as part of the European Union Copyright Directive exceptions are provided per Article 5, these exceptions are mandatory for each member state. These exceptions allow for \u201cTemporary acts of reproduction referred to in Article 2, which are transient or incidental [and] an integral and essential part of a technological process and whose sole purpose is to enable: a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary\u201d. These Laws protect both Internet Service providers and similar intermediaries who simply relay traffic. The notification you received is certainly not proof of any copyright infringement; a notice claiming infringement is not the same as a determination of infringement. I have not infringed any copyrights and do not intend to do so. Therefore, you should continue to be protected under the EUCD Article 5 without taking any further action. You may be curious about what prompted the faulty notice. It was likely triggered by a program I run called Lokinet. Lokinet is a software that helps users to enhance their privacy, security, and safety online. It does not host any content. Rather, it is part of a network of nodes called Service Nodes that operate on the Internet and simply pass packets among themselves before sending them to their destinations, just as any Internet intermediary does. The difference is that Lokinet tunnels the connections such that no hop can learn both the source and destination of the packets, giving users protection from nefarious snooping on network traffic. The result is that, unlike most other Internet traffic, the final IP address that the recipient receives is not the IP address of the sender. Lokinet protects users against hazards such as harassment, spam, and identity theft. The Lokinet software is developed by the Loki foundation a non for profit organization, and run by community Service Node operators. I hope, as an organization committed to protecting the privacy of its customers, you'll agree that this is a valuable technology. Thank you for working with me on this matter. As a loyal subscriber, I appreciate your notifying me of this issue and hope that the protections of DMCA 512 put any concerns you may have to rest. If not, please contact me with any further questions. Very truly yours, Your customer, [User] American ISP Dear [ISP]: Thank you for forwarding me the notice you received from [copyright claimant] regarding [content]. I would like to assure you that I am not hosting the claimed infringing materials, and furthermore, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's (\"DMCA\") safe harbors likely protect you from liability arising from this complaint. The notice is likely based upon misunderstandings about the law and about some of the software I run. As you know, the DMCA creates four \"safe harbors\" for service providers to protect them from copyright liability for the acts of their users, when the ISPs fulfill certain requirements. (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512) The DMCA's requirements vary depending on the ISP's role. You may be familiar with the \"notice and takedown\" provisions of section 512(c) of the DMCA; however, those do not apply when an ISP merely acts as a conduit. Instead, the \"conduit\" safe harbor of section 512(a) of the DMCA has different and less burdensome eligibility requirements, as the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held in RIAA v. Verizon (see https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/filenode/RIAA_v_Verizon/20030121-riaa-v-verizon-order.pdf) and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed in RIAA v. Charter (see https://w2.eff.org/IP/P2P/Charter/033802P.pdf). Under DMCA 512(a), service providers like you are typically protected from damages for copyright infringement claims if you also maintain \"a policy that provides for termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers and account holders of the service provider's system or network who are repeat infringers.\" If you have and implement such a policy, and you otherwise qualify for the safe harbor, you should be free from fear of copyright damages. As for what makes a reasonable policy, as the law says, it's one that terminates subscribers who are repeat infringers. The notification you received is certainly not proof of the \"repeat infringement\" that is required under the law before you need to terminate my account. In fact, it's not even proof of any copyright infringement; a notice claiming infringement is not the same as a determination of infringement. I have not infringed any copyrights and do not intend to do so. Therefore, you should continue to be protected under the DMCA 512(a) safe harbor without taking any further action.

As can be seen from the overview page, Lokinet is designed to make tracing of users impossible. The Loki network is run by hundreds of node operators who use the free software provided by the Loki Foundation to operate Lokinet routers and exit nodes. Client connections are routed through multiple relays, and are multiplexed together on the connections between relays. The system does not record logs of client connections or previous hops. This is because Lokinet is a censorship resistance, privacy, and anonymity system it can be used by whistle blowers, journalists, abuse victims, stalker Targets, law enforcement, just to name a few. Unfortunately, some people misuse the network. However, compared to the rate of legitimate use the fraction of misuse is small and abuse complaints are rare. however because of the nature of anonymity networks little can be done to trace the origin of these malicious users. //TODO: Add additional templates once DNSRBL is added Best Practices \u00b6 // TODO: insert best practices here // TODO: abuse complaints // TODO: Automated DMCA Spam Notices // TODO: traffic shaping (?) // TODO: ipv6 implications Worst Case Emergencies \u00b6 // TODO: link to EFF resources // TODO: insert info about handling police here // TODO: don't talk to the police video goes here","title":"Exit Nodes"},{"location":"Lokinet/Guides/ExitNode/#lokinet-exit-node-guide","text":"Exit nodes allow users to make requests to the wider internet and return those requests through a mixnet.

As for what makes a reasonable policy, as the law says, it's one that terminates subscribers who are repeat infringers. The notification you received is certainly not proof of the \"repeat infringement\" that is required under the law before you need to terminate my account. In fact, it's not even proof of any copyright infringement; a notice claiming infringement is not the same as a determination of infringement. I have not infringed any copyrights and do not intend to do so. Therefore, you should continue to be protected under the DMCA 512(a) safe harbor without taking any further action. You may be curious about what prompted the faulty notice. It was likely triggered by a program I run called Lokinet. Lokinet is a software that helps users to enhance their privacy, security, and safety online. It does not host any content. Rather, it is part of a network of nodes called Service Nodes that operate on the Internet and simply pass packets among themselves before sending them to their destinations, just as any Internet intermediary does. The difference is that Lokinet tunnels the connections such that no hop can learn both the source and destination of the packets, giving users protection from nefarious snooping on network traffic. The result is that, unlike most other Internet traffic, the final IP address that the recipient receives is not the IP address of the sender. Lokinet protects users against hazards such as harassment, spam, and identity theft. The Lokinet software is developed by the Loki foundation a non for profit organization, and run by community Service Node operators. I hope, as an organization committed to protecting the privacy of its customers, you'll agree that this is a valuable technology. Thank you for working with me on this matter. As a loyal subscriber, I appreciate your notifying me of this issue and hope that the protections of DMCA 512 put any concerns you may have to rest. If not, please contact me with any further questions.``` Very truly yours, Your customer, [User] General Statement The IP address in question is a Loki exit node. https://www.torproject.org/overview.html There is little we can do to trace this matter further. As can be seen from the overview page, Lokinet is designed to make tracing of users impossible. The Loki network is run by hundreds of node operators who use the free software provided by the Loki Foundation to operate Lokinet routers and exit nodes. Client connections are routed through multiple relays, and are multiplexed together on the connections between relays. The system does not record logs of client connections or previous hops. This is because Lokinet is a censorship resistance, privacy, and anonymity system it can be used by whistle blowers, journalists, abuse victims, stalker Targets, law enforcement, just to name a few. Unfortunately, some people misuse the network. However, compared to the rate of legitimate use the fraction of misuse is small and abuse complaints are rare. however because of the nature of anonymity networks little can be done to trace the origin of these malicious users. //TODO: Add additional templates once DNSRBL is added","title":"Copyright infringement Email Response"},{"location":"Lokinet/Guides/ExitNode/#best-practices","text":"// TODO: insert best practices here // TODO: abuse complaints // TODO: Automated DMCA Spam Notices // TODO: traffic shaping (?) // TODO: ipv6 implications","title":"Best Practices"},{"location":"Lokinet/Guides/ExitNode/#worst-case-emergencies","text":"// TODO: link to EFF resources // TODO: insert info about handling police here // TODO: don't talk to the police video goes here","title":"Worst Case Emergencies"},{"location":"Lokinet/Guides/HostingSNApps/","text":"Hosting a SNApp \u00b6 1.

Set up Non-root User \u00b6 Best practice when running a public server is to not run your software as the root user. We will create a non-root user to our server by running the following command. sudo adduser <username> Replacing <username> with a name you will log-in with. For this user-guide we will use lokitestnet as our username. If you use the same username the command will look like: sudo adduser lokitestnet Once ran the terminal will prompt you for a new password for your newly created user. Use a different password to the root password. Once the password has been set, the terminal will prompt for a few details about the individual running the user. You can hit enter through each of the inputs as the details are not important for the purposes of accessing Lokinet. Once that\u2019s done, run the following two commands to give our new account admin privileges and to change to such account. sudo usermod -aG sudo lokitestnet su - lokitestnet 2. Computer Preparation \u00b6 We should update our package lists, the below command downloads the package lists from the repositories and \"updates\" them to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies. It will do this for all repositories and PPAs. Run the following command: sudo apt-get update You will notice a bunch of package lists were downloaded, once this is complete run the below command to fetch new versions of any packages we currently have installed on the system. sudo apt-get upgrade You will be prompted to authorise the use of disk space, type y and enter to authorise. Note: If you are prompted at any time that a version of any file is available then click the up and down arrows until you are hovering over install the package maintainer\u2019s version and click enter. 3. Dependencies \u00b6 You will need to install some build dependencies, run the following command to install all the build dependencies required for Lokinet: sudo apt install build-essential cmake libcap-dev wget git resolvconf curl libuv1-dev Once you\u2019ve installed the dependencies we will now clone the loki-network repository: git clone https://github.com/loki-project/loki-network cd loki-network 4.

Click enter to confirm the file changes. Next we need to update our /etc/resolv.conf file by running the command: sudo resolvconf -u Optional: Building a debian package \u00b6 If you want a debian package install the debian maintainer packages needed $ sudo apt install debuild ...and then build one like so: $ debuild -us -b Finish \u00b6 Well done, you have finished the guide.

Route Configuration \u00b6 To use an exit node as a client, you need to change the [network] section in ~/.lokinet/lokinet.ini Use the following command to access your lokinet.ini file. nano ~/.lokinet/lokinet.ini Use your arrow keys to to scroll down to the network settings. # network settings [network] profiles=/home/modeify/.lokinet/profiles.dat # uncomment next line to add router with pubkey to list of routers we connect directly to #strict-connect=pubkey # uncomment next line to use router with pubkey as an exit node #exit-node=pubkey ifname=lokitun0 ifaddr=172.16.10.1/24 enabled=true Delete the # in front of strict-connect and exit-node . Replace pubkey next to strict-connect with one of the following pubkeys, also take note of the IP address attached to the pubkey. 8df8ca1cc9d39d381f0efafdf58e2569457675a1e543189bea8279522aee6461 167.114.185.46 3dcb5a34d015a7bbb4636be83991e00cbeff13fe7834e0d5452ffe9a5af5a5be 162.243.164.223 Next replace pubkey next to exit-node with the following pubkey: b61df944b8547af56201c6c7528ed86289566dcf73358c5ef8e3b4e628671399 Your network settings section should now look like the following: # network settings [network] profiles=/home/modeify/.lokinet/profiles.dat # uncomment next line to add router with pubkey to list of routers we connect d$ strict-connect=3dcb5a34d015a7bbb4636be83991e00cbeff13fe7834e0d5452ffe9a5af5a5be # uncomment next line to use router with pubkey as an exit node exit-node=b61df944b8547af56201c6c7528ed86289566dcf73358c5ef8e3b4e628671399 ifname=lokitun0 ifaddr=172.16.10.1/24 enabled=true Hold Ctrl and click x , the terminal will prompt you to confirm changes. Click y and then enter to continue. This sets our computer to use an exit node by its public identity key and sets a strict first hop by its public identity key. Setting a strict first allows for the routing table to be set up easily. 4. Finding your Default Gateway \u00b6 On linux, run the following command: ip route | grep default On macOS, run the following command: route get default | grep gateway The IP address shown is your default gateway, for our example our IP is 10.0.2.2 . 5. Set up Routes \u00b6 In the following example the first hop is 162.243.164.223 which is connected to the pubkey 3dcb5a34d015a7bbb4636be83991e00cbeff13fe7834e0d5452ffe9a5af5a5be . If you used a different pubkey as your first hop you must replace the IP address in the example with the one associated with it. Linux \u00b6 To route everything through a Lokinet Exit Node run the following command. Replacing <first hop> with your first hop IP address and <default gateway> with your default gateway. sudo ip route add <first hop> via <default gateway> For this example the command is: sudo ip route add 162.243.164.223 via 10.0.2.2 Next run the following command to remove your default: sudo ip route del default At this point make sure you are running lokinet , you should have lokinet running from section 2 . While lokinet is running open up a new terminal and run the following command: sudo ip route add default dev lokitun0 If you want to unset the route everything over lokinet route do the following as root: sudo ip route del default sudo ip route add default via <default gateway> macOS \u00b6 To route everything through a Lokinet Exit Node run the following command. Replacing <first hop> with your first hop IP address and <default gateway> with your default gateway. sudo route add <first hop> <default gateway> For this example the command is: sudo route add 162.243.164.223 10.0.2.2 Next run the following command to remove your default: sudo route delete default At this point make sure you are running lokinet , you should have lokinet running from section 2 . While lokinet is running open up a new terminal and run the following command: sudo route add default -interface lokitun0 If you want to unset the route everything over lokinet route do the following as root: sudo route delete default sudo route add default <default gateway> Done \u00b6 Now when you browse the internet your IP address will be obfuscated. Go to a \"where is my location\" website to see if your IP appears to be in Romania. Finish \u00b6 Well done, you have finished the guide.

In the context of mining, ASICs are used to compute for specific hashing algorithms. They pose a risk to decentralisation because they outpace all other mining methods, are manufactured by specific companies, have very limited distribution channels due to the specialised nature of the hardware, and they require significant capital costs to develop and operate profitably. There are potential benefits to ASICs, such as the capital cost requirements that miners must undertake to invest in algorithm specific hardware which makes it less likely that they would behave in a manner that undermines their own investment by acting dishonestly. However, the distribution and manufacture of ASIC chips, with mature hashing algorithms, is still centralised around a few large companies. These companies can refuse shipment to certain areas, decide what regions and customers get the best performing ASICs, and they can structure limited runs and manipulate prices. To prevent ASIC miners from monopolising the network hashrate, many cryptocurrencies developed ASIC resistant hashing algorithms, like Scrypt and Ethash . Until recently, Monero used the CryptoNight hashing algorithm, which requires large amounts of L3 cache to operate. In theory, this should have made it difficult to produce an ASIC chip due to large memory requirements. However in 2018 Bitmain released the X3, a CryptoNight specific ASIC that could effectively mine at ten times the speed of a graphics processing unit (GPU). Other hashing algorithms have suffered similar fates, with Scrypt, Ethash, and Equihash all now being mined by ASICs. To combat the use of ASICs, Monero proposed a strategy of hard forking every 3-6 months to slightly change the CryptoNight hashing algorithm ( the first fork moving to CryptoNightV7 ). The capital and time required to build an ASIC is significant, and with highly specific hardware designs, slight tweaks in a hashing algorithm should invalidate the chip design, wasting the time and capital investment of ASIC manufacturers. However, this approach introduces its own issues. If changes made to the algorithm are insufficient to prevent ASICs being reprogrammed, then the network can become vulnerable to hashrate centralisation until another hard fork is possible. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) should also 12 be considered in ASIC resistance strategies, where infrequent, slight changes to hashing algorithms can be easily reprogrammed for FPGAs. Another concern is that regular changes to core consensus mechanisms introduce the chance of unintended bugs and generally centralise the development of such changes around the core team of developers. A number of alternative proof-of-work algorithms have been proposed to combat the need to hard fork regularly, including provably memory-hard hashing algorithms like Argon2 , Balloon hash , and polymorphic hashing algorithms like ProgPoW and RandProg . The Loki team will be publishing additional research on the aforementioned algorithms to develop a long-term solution to ASIC resistance.

Setup \u00b6 Make sure you've already created a wallet on your PC. You'll need the wallet address to store any coins you mine. Follow the guide here to get started (follow the guide for Linux). For the SBC, download the latest non-desktop version of Raspbian . Follow their installation guide on how to write the OS image onto the MicroSD card. Once you've plugged in the SD Card, booted the Raspberry Pi, and connected it to the internet, run the following commands: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade This may take a few minutes. Next, we'll have to install some required tools to compile and run the miner. Enter this command: sudo apt-get install git automake autoconf pkg-config libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev libssl-dev libgmp-dev make g++ unzip Install the Miner \u00b6 Next, we need to obtain a CPU miner. We'll use rPi-xmrig-gcc7.3.0 Download the .zip source code from the Releases page wget https://github.com/auto-joe/rPi-xmrig-gcc7.3.0/archive/2.6.4.zip Download it to a directory of your choice and extract it to a folder called rPi-xmrig , or anything of your choice. unzip 2.6.4.zip Configure and Run the Miner \u00b6 Open the file start.sh with a text editor and replace the existing parameters with these: ./xmrig -a cryptonight-turtle -u [wallet address] -p x -o [pool address] Instead of [wallet address] , simply paste your Loki wallet address. If you don't have one yet, you can generate a paper wallet to mine towards for now, and later import into a CLI or GUI wallet. In place of [pool address] , you'll need to choose a pool to mine towards. You can check the full list here . Make the start file executable by running the following command: chmod +x start.sh Then start the miner- ./start.sh After entering this command, the miner will start scanning your hardware and begin to mine.

Follow their installation guide on how to write the OS image onto the MicroSD card. Once you've plugged in the SD Card, booted the Raspberry Pi, and connected it to the internet, run the following commands: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade This may take a few minutes. Next, we'll have to install some required tools to compile and run the miner.

Miners use computers to work on computational puzzles that change their difficulty depending on the number of miners on the network. The difficulty changes to enforce that the blocks are mined at similar time intervals, also known as the Block Generation Time. Each block generated produces a predetermined amount of cryptocurrency to the individual or party who found the solution to the puzzle. This reward is commonly known as the Block Reward and is coded to reduce its emission over time. Mining Loki \u00b6 The Loki cryptocurrency can be mined through the RandomXL hashing algorithm. How to mine Loki. \u00b6 Please note: Unfortunately because of some bad people using mining software in malware, most antivirus software will detect the programs below as unsafe. It is likely you will need to add exceptions and exclusions to your antivirus software in order to make things work properly. Unless you know what you are doing, please only download from the links below. You can currently use XMR-Stak to mine Loki. Pools \u00b6 You may view a comprehensive list of pools here . Mining Pools \u00b6 A mining pool is a hub where a group of miners share their processing power to the network. The rewards are split equally based on the amount of hashing power each individual adds to the block. In the early days of Bitcoin mining it was viable to mine as an individual. However, because there now exists tens of thousands of miners it has become less viable to mine individually due to the share of each individual being minute compared to the overal hash of the network. Loki has a number of different mining pools to choose from: Pool Total Fee Min.

Requirements \u00b6 One of: Debian 9 (\"stretch\") Debian 10 (\"buster\") Debian unstable (\"sid\") Ubuntu 16.04 (\"xenial\") Ubuntu 18.04 (\"bionic\") Ubuntu 19.04 (\"disco\") Express Guide \u00b6 Start a new service node by running these four commands: curl -s https://deb.imaginary.stream/public.gpg | sudo apt-key add - echo \"deb https://deb.imaginary.stream $(lsb_release -sc) main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/imaginary.stream.list apt update apt install loki-service-node The services will run via systemd as loki-node.service and loki-storage-server.service . Full Guide \u00b6 1: Initial Repository Setup \u00b6 You only need to do this step the first time you want to set up the repository; when you've done it once, the repository will automatically update whenever you fetch new system updates. To add the apt repository run the following command, replacing <DISTRO> in the second line with the appropriate value (see below). The following command installed Jagermans public key used to sign the Binaries. curl -s https://deb.imaginary.stream/public.gpg | sudo apt-key add - The second command tells apt where to find the packages and needs you to replace <DISTRO> with your your distro. To find your <Distro> run the following command: lsb_release -sc Alternatively your <Distro> can be found by using the following list: sid (Debian testing/unstable) stretch (Debian 9) buster (Debian 10) xenial (Ubuntu 16.04) bionic (Ubuntu 18.04) disco (Ubuntu 19.04) echo \"deb https://deb.imaginary.stream <DISTRO> main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/imaginary.stream.list Then resync your package repositories with: sudo apt update Now you can install one or more of the following packages as desired: Package Description loki-service-node Metapackage that does everything you need for a running service node. lokid The loki daemon (automatically pulled in by loki-service-node ). loki-storage-server The loki storage server, required for a service node (automatically pulled in by loki-service-node ). loki-wallet-cli The command-line wallet. loki-wallet-rpc The rpc wallet (for script-based wallet interaction such as a pool would need). loki-blockchain-tools the various loki-blockchain-* commands for advanced blockchain management. There are also a couple of libloki-core* packages containing the shared library code, but these will be installed automatically as needed. There is also a libloki-core-dev package containing the loki headers, but it's highly unlikely that you will need that for common use. Installing a Package \u00b6 To install a package run the following command replacing with one of the packages available above: sudo apt install <package> For example: To install loki-service-node package run the following command: sudo apt install loki-service-node 2. Loki Service Node Operation \u00b6 Running a service node requires multiple packages (lokid and loki-storage-server) with synchronized configuration between them. There are two ways to approach this: Automatic : \u00b6 Install the loki-service-node package. sudo apt install loki-service-node This will detect your public IP (or allow you to enter it yourself) and automatically update the loki.conf configuration file with the necessary additional settings to run a service node. Manually : \u00b6 Install both lokid and loki-storage-server packages sudo apt install lokid sudo apt install loki-storage-server Then edit the configuration in /etc/loki/loki.conf and /etc/loki/storage.conf . If you want to change some of the lokid settings you can add the settings to /etc/loki/loki.conf . Restart both after configuration updates using: systemctl restart loki-node loki-storage-server Adding flags to config file. \u00b6 Note that you can add any of lokid's command-line arguments as settings in this file rather than needing to change the service file. For example, if you wanted to run lokid as lokid --p2p-bind-ip 1.2.3.4 --p2p-bind-port=22222 --restricted-rpc then you would add: p2p-bind-ip=1.2.3.4 p2p-bind-port=22222 restricted-rpc=1 into /etc/loki/loki.conf and then restart lokid using: sudo systemctl restart loki-node 3. Interacting with the running lokid \u00b6 If you run the lokid binary with a command, it forwards this command to the running lokid. So, for example, to get the current lokid status you can run (note that sudo is not required!): lokid status lokid print_sn_status To prepare a service node registration run the following command: lokid prepare_registration The terminal will show the next steps to conduct to have your Service Node staked and thus receiving rewards. To see the outputs of your node you can run the following command: journalctl -u loki-node -af This is useful to see if your node is syncing with the blockchain. For a full list of supported commands run: lokid help For interacting with a running testnet node, add --testnet into the command, such as: lokid --testnet status lokid --testnet print_sn_status lokid --testnet prepare_registration Additional/Optional: \u00b6 Upgrading \u00b6 When a new release is available upgrading it as simple as syncing with the repository: sudo apt update Then install any updates using: sudo apt upgrade Note that this will install both updated lokid packages and any available system updates (this is generally a good thing!). During the upgrade, lokid (both mainnet and testnet) will be restarted if they are currently running to switch to the updated lokid. If for some reason you want to install only updated loki package upgrades but not other system packages then instead of the sudo apt upgrade you can use: sudo apt install loki-storage-server lokid loki-wallet-cli Installing a non-service-node lokid and cli wallet. \u00b6 To install a non-service-node lokid and the cli wallet: sudo apt install lokid loki-wallet-cli Once installed the binaries will be in your path, so you can simply run loki-wallet-cli as an ordinary user to use the command-line wallet. Non-service-node Loki operation \u00b6 Installing the lokid package sets up a loki-node systemd service that runs an ordinary loki node, but not a service node. This node can be used, for example, for wallet synchronization. If you don't want the node to run you can stop it after installation using: sudo systemctl stop loki-node If you want to disable it entirely (so that it doesn't start up automatically at boot) you can use: sudo systemctl disable --now loki-node If you later want to re-enable it you would use: sudo systemctl enable --now loki-node Remove the --now if you want to reenable it but not actually try starting it. For advanced users, lokid creates a _loki user and stores all the files (blockchain, service node key, etc.) owned by this user in /var/lib/loki . Running a Testnet Node \u00b6 The lokid package also installs a second systemd service, loki-testnet-node, for easily running a testnet node (either at the same time or instead of the mainnet node). To enable and start this, simply run: sudo systemctl enable --now loki-testnet-node This will start it and configure systemd to automatically start it when the system boots. The loki-service-node package also updates the testnet.conf file to run as a (testnet) service node; in order to actually run it you need to activate and start both the loki-testnet-node.service (as above) and also the loki-testnet-storage-server.service: sudo systemctl enable --now loki-testnet-node sudo systemctl enable --now loki-testnet-storage-server Reporting issues \u00b6 Contact me via @jagerman42 (Telegram) or @jagerman#6841 (in the Loki Discord).","title":"Installing via Debian Package Guide"},{"location":"ServiceNodes/DebianPackageGuide/#debian-package-guide","text":"Author: Jason (jagerman) Source: https://deb.imaginary.stream/ This repository contains debian/ubuntu builds of the core loki tools (lokid, cli/rpc wallets, blockchain tools) for Debian and Ubuntu.","title":"Debian Package Guide"},{"location":"ServiceNodes/DebianPackageGuide/#requirements","text":"One of: Debian 9 (\"stretch\") Debian 10 (\"buster\") Debian unstable (\"sid\") Ubuntu 16.04 (\"xenial\") Ubuntu 18.04 (\"bionic\") Ubuntu 19.04 (\"disco\")","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"ServiceNodes/DebianPackageGuide/#express-guide","text":"Start a new service node by running these four commands: curl -s https://deb.imaginary.stream/public.gpg | sudo apt-key add - echo \"deb https://deb.imaginary.stream $(lsb_release -sc) main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/imaginary.stream.list apt update apt install loki-service-node The services will run via systemd as loki-node.service and loki-storage-server.service .","title":"Express Guide"},{"location":"ServiceNodes/DebianPackageGuide/#full-guide","text":"","title":"Full Guide"},{"location":"ServiceNodes/DebianPackageGuide/#1-initial-repository-setup","text":"You only need to do this step the first time you want to set up the repository; when you've done it once, the repository will automatically update whenever you fetch new system updates.

Service Node States \u00b6 Each Service Node is in a state which informs the other Service Nodes in the network if they are awaiting, active, decommissioned or deregistered. A Service Node will be in 1 of 4 different states: State Description Awaiting Service Node is awaiting the staking requirement . Active Service Node is staked, performing tasks as required and receiving rewards . Decommissioned Service Node is not performing required tasks and is put into an inactive state where it does not receive rewards. Deregistered Service Node has been inactive for too long and has been deregistered. Decommission and Credits \u00b6 As a Service Node stays active they earn \"credits\" which are used during potential outages to stop a deregistration from occuring. A new Service Node starts out with INITIAL_CREDIT , and then builds up CREDIT_PER_DAY for each day the Service Node remains active up to a maximum of DECOMMISSION_MAX_CREDIT . Variable Value INITIAL_CREDIT 60 blocks (~2 hours) of decommission time. CREDIT_PER_DAY 24 blocks (~0.8 hours) of decommission time. DECOMMISSION_MAX_CREDIT 720 blocks (~24 hours) of decommssion time. MINIMUM 60 blocks(~2 hours) of decomission time. Example : If a Service Node stops sending uptime proofs, a quorum will consider whether the Service Node has built up enough credits (at least MINIMUM ): if so, instead of submitting a deregistration, it instead submits a decommission. This removes the Service Node from the list of active Service Nodes both for rewards and for any active network duties. If the Service Node comes back online (i.e. starts sending the required performance proofs again) before the credits run out then a quorum will reinstate the Service Node using a recommission transaction, which adds the Service Node back to the bottom of the service node reward list, and resets its accumulated credits to 0. If it does not come back online within the required number of blocks (i.e. the accumulated credit at the point of decommissioning) then a quorum will send a permanent deregistration transaction to the network, locking that nodes stake for 30-days. Testing Quorum \u00b6 The testing quorum is a random set of 10 Service Nodes that are required to test a portion of the network for uptime proofs and Service Node IP changes. At each block a new quorum is formed and they are required to test 50 Service Nodes or 1% of the network. If 7 of the 10 Service Nodes vote that a Service Node is malicious or not meeting the minimum requirements then they will create a State_Change transaction to decommission, deregister or drop a Service Node to the bottom of the rewards list. Name Details Quorum Size 10 Service Nodes. Supermajority 7 Service Nodes. Tested 50 Service Nodes or 1% of the network. Quorum Tasks \u00b6 Task Description Uptime Proofs The quorum will check to see if a Service Node has provided uptime proofs within the last 2 hours. If a Service Node is found to have not provided an uptime proof it will be decommissioned if it has at least MINIMUM credits, deregistered directly otherwise..

The commands are as follows: prepare_registration in the daemon that is running in --service-node mode. register_service_node with the command returned by the daemon. Auto staking is no longer an option. Contributors \u00b6 Two new commands have been added to stop your Service Node from staking, and both the contributor and operator can execute these commands: stake <service node key> to contribute to the node. Auto staking is no longer an option. Operators & Contributors (When Service Node Active) \u00b6 Two new commands have been added to stop your Service Node from staking, both the contributor and operator can execute these commands: (Optional) print_locked_stakes to preview all the current wallet\u2019s transactions that are locked in a Service Node or blacklisted on the network. request_stake_unlock <service node key> to request to unlock the stake in 15 days (10800 blocks). Unlocking Stakes & Deregistration \u00b6 Service Nodes will continually receive block rewards indefinitely until a stake is unlocked or the Service Node becomes deregistered. Unlocking is available via the request_stake_unlock <service node key> in the command line wallet. Once the unlock is requested and the request is included in a block in the blockchain, the Service Node will then expire in 15 days (10800 blocks) and the funds will become unlocked after expiry. In pooled nodes, any contributor that requests the stake to unlock will schedule the Service Node for expiration. All locked stakes in that Service Node will be unlocked in 15 days (10800 blocks). Once the unlock is requested, this process can not be undone or prolonged. Service Node participants will continue receiving rewards until expiration. Under the new system, deregistrations can be issued at any point during the active lifecycle of the Service Node. This is inclusive of the time period during which the Service Node is scheduled for expiry. Getting deregistered removes your Service Node from the network and your stakes are placed into a list of blacklisted transactions. Blacklisted transactions are locked and unspendable for 30 days (21600 blocks) from the block in which the Service Node was deregistered. Receiving a deregistration after participants have already requested the stake to unlock overrides the 15 day (10800 blocks) unlock time, and resets the unlock time to 30 days (21600 blocks). Minimum Contribution Rules \u00b6 Infinite Staking introduces new limitations on the number of transactions that can be contributed to a Service Node, changing the minimum contribution rules for participating in the Service Node. Service Nodes accept at most 4 contributions, meaning the minimum contribution to a Service Node becomes: In a pooled Service Node with reserved spots, the Minimum Contribution must be either the Reserved Amount or the Contribution determined by the above equation, whichever is larger. A simplistic example being, if the staking requirement is 24,000 Loki then if, Operator contributes 50% of the requirement (12,000 Loki) The next contributor must contribute at least (\u2153 * 12,000) Loki i.e. 4000 Loki to become a participant. If this contributor had reserved a spot for more than 4000 Loki, their Minimum Contribution would be that amount. There are rules in the client software in place to stop users from irreversibly funding a Service Node into an invalid state. Staking Changes \u00b6 Users are no longer allowed to stake on behalf of another participant in the Service Node. All contributions for a participant must come from the same wallet address as the one specified in the Service Node.

If you feel confident around servers and the CLI, then skip to the Express Setup Guide You can of course run the Loki software on any operating system that you can get it to build on, but for the purposes of this document, the instructions apply to running a Service Node on a remote Ubuntu 18.04 server. If that isn\u2019t what you want to do, syntax and server set up will of course differ according to whatever OS you choose to run your Service Node from. Summary of Loki Service Node Requirements \u00b6 Full summary of Loki Service Node Requirements. This may change depending on Service Node functionality, so you should check here regularly, or follow our Telegram / Discord announcements channel. Spec Note Latest Binary Hefty Heimdall Software Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 19.04 Storage 18gb Ram 2-4 gb Table of Contents \u00b6 Overview of Service Nodes New User Guide Step 1 Server Step 2 Server Prep Step 3 Loki Launcher Step 4 Service File Step 5 Open a Loki Wallet Step 6 Register Node Step 7 Check Registration Step 8 Unlock Stake (optional) Express Setup Guide Overview \u00b6 To understand what a Service Node is, you can refer to the whitepaper to get an in depth understanding. For now, all you need to know is that: Service Nodes are full nodes on the Loki network Full nodes become Service Nodes when the owner locks the required amount of Loki and submits a registration transaction. Once accepted by the network, the Service Node is eligible to win block rewards. Multiple participants can be involved in one Service Node and can have the reward automatically distributed. Receive, store and forward encrypted user messages. Act as remote nodes for users. It is also worth noting that Service Nodes are quite basic at the moment, and operators will need to stay up to date with new updates to keep in line with software and hardware requirements. Once all of the updates are out, Service Nodes will also: Route end user\u2019s internet traffic, either as an exit node or relay in a novel mixnet. Monitor other Service Nodes and vote on their performance. Be called into quorums which give them authority over instant transactions ( Blink ). Once these features come out, Service Node operation will require better servers, particularly when it comes to bandwidth. For the purposes of this guide, however, we will only consider the current requirements. New User Guide \u00b6 This section of this guide is for new users to servers and the CLI interface. Step 1 - Get a Server \u00b6 Righto! Let\u2019s get started. Choosing where to set up a Service Node is the biggest choice you will make when running a Service Node. There are a number of things to consider. Because you will be locking up funds indefinitly, you will want to ensure that your server has: A stable, relatively fast connection to be able to respond to ping requests to avoid being booted off the network. We recommend 2GB of RAM to cope with running the software reliably ( Note: This requirement may be much greater once services are live ). 1GB is fine for testing. At Least a 20GB SSD or Hard disk drive, this will be used to store the blockchain ( Note: to future proof yourself against blockchain growth and message storage we recommend a 30 - 40 GB drive ). A stable power supply. If your server goes down during the staking period, you may get kicked off the network, and not receive rewards while your funds are still locked for the remainder of the staking period. For most users, we assume that your home internet connection is relatively slow (< 4MB/s down and up) and probably lacks support for external connections. If this is the case, you will probably not want to run a Service Node from your home in the long term, as this could cost you if and when you get booted off. Since we\u2019re just testing at the moment, you could run it from home anyway, but for this guide we\u2019ll avoid it. Typically, the easiest and cheapest way to host a server outside of your home is to use a Virtual Private Server (VPS). There are thousands of options when it comes to VPS providers, but for now, just about any one will do. In the future, selection will be made more difficult because most providers will not allow exit node traffic, so we have compiled a list of exit node friendly providers to choose from if you want to stay with your provider for more than a few months. Hosting Provider Product Name Cost Per Month $USD Bandwidth Provided Exit Friendliness Rating Netcup VPS 1000 G8 10.50 30 - 35 MiB\u2019s 5 / 10 Online.net Start-2-S-SSD 13.99 15 - 17 MiB\u2019s 9 / 10 Scaleway START1-M 9.33 20 - 25 MiB\u2019s 7 / 10 OVH VPS SSD 2 7.61 9 - 1 MiB\u2019s 9 / 10 Leaseweb Virtual Server XL 34.45 30 - 35 MiB\u2019s 5 / 10 Digital Ocean 2 GB, 2 vCPUs 15 9 - 11 MiB\u2019s 8 / 10 Feral Hosting Neon Capability 19.68 9 - 11 MiB\u2019s 9 / 10 Trabia VDS-8G 38.54 9 - 11 MiB\u2019s 8 / 10 Hetzner EX41-SSD (30 TB) 39.71 40 - 80 MiB\u2019s 4 / 10 Note: We do not officially endorse any of these providers, this list is simply illustrative of some of the options currently available* Try not to pick the first one off the list. Do some digging and see which one looks the best to you, what your budget is, and what the latency is like for you based on the server location that you choose. When selecting your VPS\u2019 operating system, choose Ubuntu 18.04 64 bit or Ubuntu 19.04 64 bit if you want to follow this guide. If you feel more confident or wish to run your server on another distribution or operating system, the Loki commands in this guide will still apply. Step 2 - Prepare your Server \u00b6 Every provider has a slightly different way of issuing you access to your new VPS. Most will send an email with the IP address, root username, and a root password of the VPS. To access your server, you will need a SSH client for your operating system. Because we\u2019re on Windows today, we\u2019ll download PuTTY, Mac users can also use PuTTY. If you\u2019re a Linux user, you probably don\u2019t want us telling you where to get a SSH client from. To connect to our VPS we will need to paste the IP address into the SSH client\u2019s \u201cHost Name (or IP address)\u201d input box and click the \u201cOpen\u201d button. The Port number can usually just be left as 22 . A terminal window will now appear prompting for your log-in details, username(root) and password, which were provided by your VPS provider. When entering your password, nothing will visually appear in the terminal. This is normal. Hit enter when it\u2019s typed or pasted, and you should be logged in to your VPS. 2.1 Create a non-root User \u00b6 Best practice when running a public server is to not run your software as the root user. Although it is possible to do everything as root, it is strongly recommended that you create a non-root user on our VPS by running the following command: adduser <username> Replacing <username> with a name you will log-in with. For this user-guide we will use snode as our username. adduser snode The terminal will prompt you for a new password for our newly created user. Use a secure password that is different password from the root password. Once the password has been set, the terminal will prompt for a few details about the individual running the user. You can just hit enter through each of the inputs as the details are not important for the purposes of running a Service Node. Once that\u2019s done, run the following two commands to give our new account admin privileges and to change to such account. usermod -aG sudo snode sudo su - snode Before we proceed further, it is advised to close your terminal and reopen PuTTY to set up a saved session with our snode user. Your SSH client will have a load and save session function. For PuTTY we will need to type in our VPS IP address again, on the same screen type snode under \u201cSaved Session\u201d. Click on \u201cData\u201d under the drop-down menu \u201cConnection\u201d, and type in snode (or your username defined before) into the input box \u201cAuto-login username\u201d. Go back to your session screen, where we entered the IP address, and click \u201cSave\u201d. You can load this session whenever you want to check on your Service Node. 2.2 Hot Tips for using the Console \u00b6 Consoles don't work like the rest of your computer. Here are some basic tips for navigating your way around the command line! Don't try copying something by using the usual Ctrl + C hotkey! If you want to copy something, do so by highlighting text and then right clicking it. Pasting works by right clicking a blank area in the console. If you want to kill a process or stop something from running, press Ctrl + C. (This is why you shouldn't try copying something with this hotkey.) You can always check the directory you are in by typing pwd and list its contents by typing ls . You can always return to your home directory by typing cd . You can move into a given directory by typing cd <name> or move back up one level by typing cd .. . PuTTY allows you to easily duplicate or restart a session by right clicking the top of the window. Handy if you\u2019re trying to do a few things at once. Once we have logged in correctly to the VPS for the first time, the VPS may be configured to prompt for a new password for the root account. The terminal will require you to enter the new password twice before we can start running commands. If you aren't prompted for a new root password but want to change it anyway, type sudo passwd . Choose something very secure! 2.3 Server Preparation Continued \u00b6 We should update our package lists, the below command downloads the package lists from the repositories and \"updates\" them to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies. It will do this for all repositories and PPAs. sudo apt update You will notice a bunch of package lists were downloaded, once this is complete run the below command to fetch new versions of any packages we currently have installed on the system. sudo apt upgrade You will be prompted to authorise the use of disk space, type y and enter to authorise. If you are prompted during the upgrade that a new version of any file is available then click the up and down arrows until you are hovering over install the package maintainer\u2019s version and click enter. Alright, good to go. Our server is now set up, up to date, and is not running as root. On to the fun part! Step 3 - Loki Launcher \u00b6 3.1 - Install NodeJS and Loki Launcher \u00b6 In order to use the Loki Launcher we first need to install NodeJS. Run the following command to download the package: curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash - Then run the following command to install nodejs: sudo apt-get install -y nodejs Next we need to install the launcher with the following command: sudo npm install -g loki-launcher 3.2 - Setting up your Loki-launcher for Service Node \u00b6 We now need to prequalify our server to be ready to run as a service node. To do so run the following command: loki-launcher prequal If all checks have passed you will receive an output similar to the following: Starting open port check on configured blockchain p2p port: 22022 OpenP2pPort: Success ! Starting open port check on configured storage server port: 8080 OpenStoragePort: Success ! Starting disk space check on blockchain partition /home/snode/.loki Creating /home/snode/.loki/storage Starting disk space check on storage server partition /home/snode/.loki/storage DiskSpace_blockchain: Success ! DiskSpace_storage: Success ! Your node successfully passed all tests 3.3 - Download Lokid Binaries \u00b6 We will download the Loki binaries by running the following command: sudo loki-launcher download-binaries 3.4 - Start the Loki Launcher \u00b6 To start the loki launcher run the following command: sudo loki-launcher start At this moment the launcher will output a table showing if everything is working properly: \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 (index) \u2502 Values \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524 \u2502 launcher \u2502 'running as 26525' \u2502 \u2502 blockchain \u2502 'running as 26537' \u2502 \u2502 socket \u2502 'running at /opt/loki-launcher/var' \u2502 \u2502 blockchain_rpc \u2502 'running on 127.0.0.1:22023' \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 Now the Loki launcher is running we can access the launcher by running the following command: sudo loki-launcher client To exit out of the client click CTRL + C . Note: Loki-launcher will run in the background now and continue to sync with the blockchain. The only problem is if the system reboots we will need to relaunch the loki-launcher software. We can fix this by configuring the Launcher as a system service which makes it automatically start up if the server reboots, and restarts it if the software crashes for some reason. Step 4 - Loki-Launcher as a System Service \u00b6 4.1 - User permissions \u00b6 We are going to need to fix our user \"snode\"s permissions with the loki-launcher. To do this we need to swap back to root: su - root Next run the following command to fix permissions: loki-launcher fix-perms <USER> Replacing <USER> with snode or the username that you created. The terminal should show the following: 3.x series blockchain binary detected, disabling storage server by default running fix-perms requesting launcher stop setting permissions to snode user snode uid is 1000 homedir is /home/snode remember to restart your launcher fixing blockchain.data_dir file /home/snode/.loki/key fixing blockchain.data_dir file /home/snode/.loki/loki.log fixing blockchain.data_dir file /home/snode/.loki/p2pstate.bin fixing blockchain.data_dir file /home/snode/.loki/lmdb/data.mdb fixing blockchain.data_dir file /home/snode/.loki/lmdb/lock.mdb fixing blockchain.data_dir file /home/snode/.loki/lmdb fixing blockchain.data_dir file /home/snode/.loki/storage/storage.logs fixing blockchain.data_dir file /home/snode/.loki/storage fixing blockchain.data_dir file /home/snode/.loki Once the permissions have been set let's change back to our other user snode by running the following command: su - snode Now let's get the loki-launcher started again: sudo loki-launcher start 4.2 - Creating the Service File \u00b6 To create our lokid.service file run the following command: sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lokid.service Next copy the text below and paste it into your new file. To paste in putty you can right mouse click the terminal screen. [Unit] Description=lokilauncher After=network-online.target [Service] Type=simple User=snode ExecStart=/usr/lib/node_modules/loki-launcher/index.js systemd-start Restart=always RestartSec=30s [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target If you chose a username other than snode then change snode in the User= line to the alternative username. Once completed, save the file and quit nano: CTRL+X -> Y -> ENTER . 4.3 - Enabling the Service File \u00b6 Reload systemd manager configuration (to make it re-read the new service file): sudo systemctl daemon-reload Enable lokid.service so that it starts automatically upon boot: sudo systemctl enable lokid.service Start lokid.service: sudo systemctl start lokid.service Then reboot your system to check if the service file is working correctly. sudo reboot Log back into your server and run the following command: loki-launcher status The terminal should output something similar to: launcher status: running on 818 blockchain status: running on 891 Well done! You're loki-launcher is now setup. Step 5 - Wallet \u00b6 While we wait for the daemon to sync, we can now get a wallet going. You do not have to run this wallet on the server and you should not! Download the software and run it from elsewhere for security reasons! If you need help with installing the loki-wallet-cli on another machine check out our Wallets Overview section. 5.1 - Run Wallet \u00b6 To open our wallet we are going to change into the directory which we installed loki-wallet-cli and run the following command: ./loki-wallet-cli If you are on testnet run the command with the --testnet flag: ~/loki/loki-wallet-cli --testnet When loki-wallet-cli first runs, it will request for you to specify a wallet name. Assuming we haven't created one yet, we will use the e.g. name MyWallet Because this is the first time we have used the name MyWallet the client will prompt us to create a new wallet. Type y and click return to continue. The loki-wallet-cli has generated us a wallet called MyWallet and is now prompting us for a password. Note : When typing the password, the characters will not appear. It will seem as if you are typing and no text is appearing however the terminal is logging every character you type including if it is capitalised or lowercase. Write down your wallet name and password on a piece of paper as this information will be required every time we want to enter our wallet. Use a password with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols and make the password at least 9 characters long. Once we have chosen our password for the wallet we must choose our language. For the purposes of this user guide I suggest you use English by typing in 1 and clicking return. The CLI will generate and spit out several lines of text. The first two lines of text show your wallet public address. This address can be shared, will be used to receive Loki to your wallet, and will be used during the preparation and registration of our Service Node. All Mainnet Loki public addresses start with an L and are followed with a string of characters, Testnet Public addresses start with a T. The public address shown will be your primary address, however multiple public addresses can be generated from this primary address. 5.2 - Save Seed Phrase \u00b6 Line 13 to 17 show your 25-word mnemonic (\u201cnew-monic\u201d) seed. The seed is used to easily backup and restore your wallet without needing any other information. At this stage, grab a pen and paper, and write down your 25 words in order. Store the piece of paper in a safe and secure place, if your words are stored in a text file on your computer or stored online, you increase your risk of someone else getting control of your wallet. 5.3 - Store enough $loki in your wallet for staking \u00b6 It is at this point that we should get some Loki in the wallet. The amount of Loki required to run a node is derived from the function shown in Lokis Cryptoeconomic paper . Don't worry if you cant work out the formula, you can use this community created tool or, the daemon will display the amount of Loki required to run the node. If you do not have enough you will have the option to join in or run your own Service Node pool. If you are running a Service Node on the testnet you will only ever require 100 testnet Loki to run the Node. You can ask the Telegram @LokiSNBot for some testnet loki or ask someone in the Loki Discord Community for some. 5.4 - Information required for the Service Node \u00b6 If you are staking please do not use Subaddresses. They are currently unsupported by the Loki wallet. We will need our address to register our Service Node later, to get your primary address type the following command: address Highlight the string of characters that were outputted and save this in a notepad for later use, your public address should look similar to: T6TCCyDgjjbddtzwNGryRJ5HntgGYvqZTagBb2mtHhn7WWz7i5JDeqhFiHqu7ret56411ZJS7Thfeis718bVteBZ2UA6Y7G2d (Note that this is an example testnet wallet address; your address will start with L if it is a mainnet wallet) NOTE: Do not use CTRL + C to copy your address, it will close the wallet down. Simply highlight the address and this will automatically save the portion you highlighted into your clipboard. Once you have enough Loki in this wallet, just leave it open, we\u2019ll come back to it in a minute. Step 6 - Service Node Registration \u00b6 The next part of the guide will split into two sections: If you are an individual staker and do not require any other contributors to run your Service Node jump into 6.1 - individual Staking . If you want to run a pooled Service Node or contribute towards a pool jump into 6.2 - Pool Staking 6.1 - Individual Staking \u00b6 If you want to run the Service Node as an individual you will require the following things. A loki-launcher initialised with loki-launcher prequal . See Step 3.2 A fully synchronized, up-to-date Loki daemon running through the loki-launcher. A loki-wallet-cli primary address with enough Loki in your account to meet the Service Node Staking Requirement. See Step 5 Now if we have the three above items we can proceed to our daemon to register our Service Node. Log in (if not already connected) as the snode user on the VPS running the service node, then connect to the loki-launcher client: loki-launcher client Start the registration process by running the following interactive command: prepare_registration The daemon will output the current staking requirement and prompt you with an input to clarify whether you are an individual staker or you will be running a pool. Type y and click enter as we will be the sole staker. The daemon will now prompt us for the Loki address of the operator. If you followed step 5 you should have this address saved in a notepad, if not run through step 5 again to find your Loki Address. Once we have the Loki Address copied to our clipboard we can then right click the terminal screen to paste the address. Double check the address matches the one of your wallet then click enter if it is the same. The daemon will now ask for a final confirmation, if you agree to the information provided type y and click enter. The daemon will output a command for us to run looking similar to: register_service_node 4294967292 T6TCCyDgjjbddtzwNGryRJ5HntgGYvqZTagBb2mtHhn7WWz7i5JDeqhFiHqu7ret56411ZJS7Thfeis718bVteBZ2UA6Y7G2d 4294967292 100.000000000 1535677391 ec3895ea70a4a91b5ec4b5e1df96a45e07046f1fb0123c754d98fb2d70f4529d 5bb35d7b8ab1acb943bc47913ada8f9d2e6d6e22264e57484a04c1bbfd461f0ee2e5435454cd9b7059b221eb506ce9ea4537ddd9faf1f1757e0ef611a41c0609 NOTE: You must run the command outputed by your daemon and not the command shown above. Copy the whole line of text and paste it into your notepad as we will need to run this command in our loki-wallet-cli . If registering multiple nodes, it will likely be necessary to wait at least 10 blocks between Service Nodes before running the register Service Node command in the wallet. You have 2 weeks from the moment of preparing the registration command on the Service Node to actually run the register_service_node command in the wallet, however it is advised to do it as soon as possible. Run through step 5 once more to open our Loki wallet (if you don't already have it open). Once we are in our wallet run the command the daemon outputted for us when we prepared our Service Node registration. The wallet will prompt us to confirm our password, then the amount of Loki to stake. Confirm this by typing y and clicking enter. Note: At this point you now have locked stakes! To unlock your stake run the following Well done! Let's continue to the next step \" Step 7 - Service Node Check \" to check if our Service Node is running. 6.2 - Pool Staking \u00b6 Minimum Contribution Rules \u00b6 Infinite Staking introduces new limitations on the number of transactions that can be contributed to a Service Node, changing the minimum contribution rules for participating in the Service Node. Service Nodes accept at most 4 contributions, meaning the minimum contribution to a Service Node becomes: In a pooled Service Node with reserved spots, the Minimum Contribution must be either the Reserved Amount or the Contribution determined by the above equation, whichever is larger. A simplistic example being, if the staking requirement is 24,000 Loki then if, Operator contributes 50% of the requirement (12,000 Loki) The next contributor must contribute at least (\u2153 * 12,000) Loki i.e. 4000 Loki to become a participant. If this contributor had reserved a spot for more than 4000 Loki, their Minimum Contribution would be that amount. There are rules in the client software in place to stop users from irreversibly funding a Service Node into an invalid state. Depending on the individual and their circumstance they will need to: Jump into section 6.2.1 - Operator if they are running the daemon and hosting the pool; Jump into section 6.2.2 - Pool Contributor if they are contributing to someone's Service Node. NOTE: It is advised to read both sections of \" 6.2 - Pool Staking \" to have a better understanding of the process. 6.2.1 - Operator \u00b6 The Operator is the individual who will be hosting the pool and running the Service Node daemon, thus incurring the operating expenses encompassed by running a node. The Operator will need to have: A loki-launcher initialised with loki-launcher prequal . See Step 3.2 . A fully synchronized, up-to-date Loki daemon running through the loki-launcher. A loki-wallet-cli primary address with enough Loki in your account to meet the Service Node Staking Requirement. See Step 5 1-3 other contributors who also have a wallet ( loki-wallet-cli or the desktop GUI wallet) with enough Loki in their accounts to meet 25% of the staking requirement. If the operator wants to reserve contribution spots for specific contributors: The address and contribution amounts the 1-3 contributors will stake. NOTE: The other contributors addresses are optional to have as you can create your pool to be open to anyone to contribute to, however they are recommended to have to avoid any issues of other individuals stealing their spots. On the other hand, a reserved contribution spot can only be filled by that contributor: if they change their mind before submitting a stake your service node will be stuck inactive, so it is recommended to use reserved contribution spots only with contributors you trust. Now if we have the three/four above items we can proceed to our daemon to register our Service Node. Log in (if not already connected) as the snode user on the VPS running the service node, then connect to the loki-launcher client: loki-launcher client Start the registration process by running the following interactive command: prepare_registration The terminal will prompt the operator to specify if they will contribute the entire stake, because we are running this as a pooled Service Node we will type n and click enter. Next the terminal will request the input for the operator cut. This value is between 0-100 and represents the percentage of the reward the operator will receive before the reward is distributor to the share holders. If you have agreed to a 10% operator cut with the other contributors you would type 10 and click return. The terminal will now display the minimum reserve the operator can contribute and request the operator to input the amount in Loki they wish to contribute. Type your desired <operator contribution> and click return. Once we have set the operators desired stake amount we have the option to either leave the pool open for anyone to contribute or lock a reserve for individuals that have agreed with us to stake within our Service Node. Reserved Pool \u00b6 If the operator wishes to reserve spots for specific contributors they should type y and click return. The terminal will now prompt the operator for the number of additional contributors they have organised to be apart of this Service Node. Type in the number of reserved contributors, not including themselves, and click return. The daemon will now prompt us for the Loki address of the operator. If you followed step 5 you should have this address saved in a notepad, if not run through step 5 again to find your address. Once we have the Loki Address copied to our clipboard we can then right click the terminal screen to paste the address then click return to confirm your address. Next the operator must input the amount of Loki each contributor will contribute and the contributor's address. NOTE: It is possible to reserve only some of the required stakes for specific contributors while leaving the remaining stake open. You will now be asked to confirm the information above is correct. Open Pool \u00b6 If the operator wishes to leave their pool complete open to contributions they should type n and click return. The terminal will prompt the operator to input their address. Once the address has been inputted the terminal will display the remaining portion that needs to be contributed by others. If you agree click y and hit return. The daemon will display a summary of the information we entered. This is our chance for a final check over to make sure we entered in the right information. If you confirm the information is correct type y and click return. The daemon will output a command for us to run within our wallet, looking similar to: register_service_node 214748364 T6UCEoWvJHCJq5biK3LMQZ4CRXAaqiPda2kCRRYYYEMFfxYoqnUo7Nx88RL3wmENwN4kfjDSp2jMN1g6PSErKrSu2EEp8UMy5 1073741823 T6TCCyDgjjbddtzwNGryRJ5HntgGYvqZTagBb2mtHhn7WWz7i5JDeqhFiHqu7ret56411ZJS7Thfeis718bVteBZ2UA6Y7G2d 3221225469 25.000000000 1535692249 5dac247e90ced2dcd9e51faec8792acb0c11b4c700640d9104b17c868ea167e3 cc11eef804c11d3e93cf8c488c10d97b8cec9ee2b38e6666ff07749c2911aa06ce310edc926a4d2f50a588e9c15afcc20e935a0f188aa7caa764a62058dec80d NOTE: You must run the command outputed by your daemon and not the command shown above. Copy the whole line of text in your daemon and paste it into your notepad as we will need to run this command in our loki-wallet-cli . You have 2 weeks from the moment of registering the Service Node to run the register_service_node command, however it is advised to do it as soon as possible. Before you disconnect from your VPS connect to the loki-launcher client : loki-launcher client and run the following command to get your <Service Node Public Key> and save it in your notepad (your contributors will need it): print_sn_key Run through step 5 once more to open our Loki wallet. Once we are in our wallet run the command the daemon outputted for us when we prepared our Service Node. The wallet will prompt us to confirm our password, then the amount of Loki to stake. Confirm this by typing y and clicking enter. Once this command completes your staking transaction will be sent to be included on the blockchain. It may take a few minutes for the transaction to be mined into a block; you can check the status using the loki-launcher and running the command: print_sn_status or by looking for your <Service Node Public Key> in the \"Service Nodes Awaiting\" section on lokiblocks.com (or lokitestnet.com for a testnet service node). Once the service node registration is received you can send the <Service Node Public Key> to your contributors with the amount of Loki they are required to stake. NOTE: the final amount will typically be slightly lower than what you entered in the prepare_registration command. This is expected: the required amounts are based on the registration block height which has usually advanced by a couple blocks between the time you prepared the registration and the time it gets mined into the blockchain. At this point we will need to wait until all contributors have staked before the service node activates and becomes eligible to receive rewards. 6.2.2 - Pool Contributor \u00b6 The pool contributor must first receive the Service Node Pubkey and the requirements (amount of loki to send) from the Service Node Operator. If you are staking please do not use Subaddresses. They are currently unsupported by the Loki wallet The pool contributor must have downloaded the necessary binaries, is running a daemon or is connected to a remote node, has generated a wallet through either the loki-wallet-cli or the desktop GUI wallet, and has enough Loki to stake. They can then run the following command in their loki-wallet-cli . stake <Service Node Pubkey> <contribution amount> Where the <Service Node Pubkey> is the Pubkey provided from the Service Node operator and <contribution amount> is the amount of Loki they are going to stake which they agreed to with the Service Node Operator. If using the desktop GUI wallet, the Stake command can be found under the Advanced - Service Node menu. Enter the service <Service Node Pubkey> and <contribution amount> and hit the Stake button. At this stage you will need to wait for the other contributors to provide their collateral. Once everyone has staked you can refer to \u201cStep 7 - Service Node Check\u201d to see where your Service Node Operator\u2019s node is in the list. Congratulations, you are now staking. Step 7 - Service Node Check \u00b6 After we have locked our collateral we will need to check if our Service Node Pubkey is sitting in the list with the other Service Node\u2019s on the network. This will prove our Service Node is running, recognised and will receive a reward if it keeps running. Connect to the VPS where the service node is running and run the following command in our loki-launcher client to see our Service Node Public Key: print_sn_key The Service Node Public Key is used to identify our Service Node within the list of Service Nodes currently on the network. If you want more detailed Service Node status you can use the follow command: print_sn_status You can jump onto https://lokiblocks.com/ to see if your Service Node is in the list or we can continue in the terminal to output the same information. If you are running your Service Node on testnet go to https://lokitestnet.com/ instead. To check this information directly with the service node itself, first get the current block height by running status into the terminal with loki-launcher client launched.. Once we have the block height we can then check the current Service Nodes on the network at our specified block height. Run the following command in the loki-launcher : print_quorum_state <block height> Replacing <block height> with the number minus 1 that was outputted when running status command. If your <Service Node Pubkey> is sitting in the list you know you are now staking. Step 8 - Unlock Stake \u00b6 Service Nodes will continually receive block rewards indefinitely until a stake is unlocked or the Service Node becomes deregistered. Unlocking is available via the following command which needs to be run in the command line wallet: request_stake_unlock <service node key> Once the unlock is requested and the request is included in a block in the blockchain, the Service Node will then expire in 15 days (10800 blocks) and the funds will become unlocked after expiry. In pooled nodes, any contributor that requests the stake to unlock will schedule the Service Node for expiration. All locked stakes in that Service Node will be unlocked in 15 days (10800 blocks). Once the unlock is requested, this process can not be undone or prolonged. Service Node participants will continue receiving rewards until expiration. Deregistrations can be issued at any point during the active lifecycle of the Service Node. This is inclusive of the time period during which the Service Node is scheduled for expiry. Getting deregistered removes your Service Node from the network and your stakes are placed into a list of blacklisted transactions. Blacklisted transactions are locked and unspendable for 30 days (21600 blocks) from the block in which the Service Node was deregistered. Receiving a deregistration after participants have already requested the stake to unlock overrides the 15 day (10800 blocks) unlock time, and resets the unlock time to 30 days (21600 blocks). Optional \u00b6 See Locked Stake Amount and Duration \u00b6 We can also view our locked stake by running the following command from our loki-wallet-cli we staked from: print_locked_stakes Updating your Binaries \u00b6 When new binaries are out we need to log into our server as the which we initially set up our loki-launcher on. Run the following command to update our loki-launcher: sudo npm install -g loki-launcher Stop our lokid.service file: sudo systemctl stop lokid.service Then run the following command to download the new binaries: loki-launcher download-binaries Start lokid.service again: sudo systemctl start lokid.service If you are running loki-launcher as a service you can now reboot your computer and the new binaries will be used. sudo reboot Default Directories for Loki Files \u00b6 Name Directory Blockchain Data /home/<user>/.loki/ Lokid Binaries /opt/loki-launcher/bin Launcher Config File /etc/loki-launcher/launcher.ini Lokid Logs /home/<user>/.loki/ Express Setup Guide \u00b6 Step 1: Get a Server Step 2: Prepare your server adduser snode usermod -aG sudo snode sudo su - snode sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade Step 3: Loki-Launcher curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash - sudo apt-get install -y nodejs sudo npm install -g loki-launcher loki-launcher prequal sudo loki-launcher download-binaries sudo loki-launcher start sudo loki-launcher client To exit out of the client click CTRL + C .

Once accepted by the network, the Service Node is eligible to win block rewards. Multiple participants can be involved in one Service Node and can have the reward automatically distributed. Receive, store and forward encrypted user messages. Act as remote nodes for users. It is also worth noting that Service Nodes are quite basic at the moment, and operators will need to stay up to date with new updates to keep in line with software and hardware requirements. Once all of the updates are out, Service Nodes will also: Route end user\u2019s internet traffic, either as an exit node or relay in a novel mixnet. Monitor other Service Nodes and vote on their performance. Be called into quorums which give them authority over instant transactions ( Blink ).

Let\u2019s get started. Choosing where to set up a Service Node is the biggest choice you will make when running a Service Node. There are a number of things to consider. Because you will be locking up funds indefinitly, you will want to ensure that your server has: A stable, relatively fast connection to be able to respond to ping requests to avoid being booted off the network. We recommend 2GB of RAM to cope with running the software reliably ( Note: This requirement may be much greater once services are live ). 1GB is fine for testing. At Least a 20GB SSD or Hard disk drive, this will be used to store the blockchain ( Note: to future proof yourself against blockchain growth and message storage we recommend a 30 - 40 GB drive ). A stable power supply. If your server goes down during the staking period, you may get kicked off the network, and not receive rewards while your funds are still locked for the remainder of the staking period. For most users, we assume that your home internet connection is relatively slow (< 4MB/s down and up) and probably lacks support for external connections. If this is the case, you will probably not want to run a Service Node from your home in the long term, as this could cost you if and when you get booted off. Since we\u2019re just testing at the moment, you could run it from home anyway, but for this guide we\u2019ll avoid it. Typically, the easiest and cheapest way to host a server outside of your home is to use a Virtual Private Server (VPS). There are thousands of options when it comes to VPS providers, but for now, just about any one will do. In the future, selection will be made more difficult because most providers will not allow exit node traffic, so we have compiled a list of exit node friendly providers to choose from if you want to stay with your provider for more than a few months.

Do some digging and see which one looks the best to you, what your budget is, and what the latency is like for you based on the server location that you choose. When selecting your VPS\u2019 operating system, choose Ubuntu 18.04 64 bit or Ubuntu 19.04 64 bit if you want to follow this guide.

Use a secure password that is different password from the root password. Once the password has been set, the terminal will prompt for a few details about the individual running the user. You can just hit enter through each of the inputs as the details are not important for the purposes of running a Service Node. Once that\u2019s done, run the following two commands to give our new account admin privileges and to change to such account. usermod -aG sudo snode sudo su - snode Before we proceed further, it is advised to close your terminal and reopen PuTTY to set up a saved session with our snode user. Your SSH client will have a load and save session function. For PuTTY we will need to type in our VPS IP address again, on the same screen type snode under \u201cSaved Session\u201d. Click on \u201cData\u201d under the drop-down menu \u201cConnection\u201d, and type in snode (or your username defined before) into the input box \u201cAuto-login username\u201d. Go back to your session screen, where we entered the IP address, and click \u201cSave\u201d. You can load this session whenever you want to check on your Service Node.","title":"2.1 Create a non-root User"},{"location":"ServiceNodes/SNFullGuide/#22-hot-tips-for-using-the-console","text":"Consoles don't work like the rest of your computer.

If you want to kill a process or stop something from running, press Ctrl + C. (This is why you shouldn't try copying something with this hotkey.) You can always check the directory you are in by typing pwd and list its contents by typing ls . You can always return to your home directory by typing cd .

Unlocking is available via the following command which needs to be run in the command line wallet: request_stake_unlock <service node key> Once the unlock is requested and the request is included in a block in the blockchain, the Service Node will then expire in 15 days (10800 blocks) and the funds will become unlocked after expiry. In pooled nodes, any contributor that requests the stake to unlock will schedule the Service Node for expiration. All locked stakes in that Service Node will be unlocked in 15 days (10800 blocks). Once the unlock is requested, this process can not be undone or prolonged. Service Node participants will continue receiving rewards until expiration. Deregistrations can be issued at any point during the active lifecycle of the Service Node. This is inclusive of the time period during which the Service Node is scheduled for expiry. Getting deregistered removes your Service Node from the network and your stakes are placed into a list of blacklisted transactions. Blacklisted transactions are locked and unspendable for 30 days (21600 blocks) from the block in which the Service Node was deregistered.

This may change depending on Service Node functionality, so you should check here regularly, or follow our Telegram / Discord announcements channel.

For now, all you need to know is that: Service Nodes are full nodes on the Loki network Full nodes become Service Nodes when the owner locks the required amount of Loki and submits a registration transaction. Once accepted by the network, the Service Node is eligible to win block rewards. Multiple participants can be involved in one Service Node and can have the reward automatically distributed It is also worth noting that Service Nodes are quite basic at the moment, and operators will need to stay up to date with new updates to keep in line with software and hardware requirements. Once all of the updates are out, Service Nodes will also: Route end user\u2019s internet traffic, either as an exit node or relay in a novel mixnet. Receive, store and forward encrypted user messages. Monitor other Service Nodes and vote on their performance. Be called into quorums which give them authority over instant transactions ( Blink ). Act as remote nodes for users. Once these features come out, Service Node operation will require better servers, particularly when it comes to bandwidth. For the purposes of this guide, however, we will only consider the current requirements. New User Guide \u00b6 This section of this guide is for new users to servers and the CLI interface. Step 1 - Get a Server \u00b6 Righto! Let\u2019s get started. Choosing where to set up a Service Node is the biggest choice you will make when running a Service Node. There are a number of things to consider. Because you will be locking up funds for 30 days (2 days for testnet) at a time, you will want to ensure that your server has: A stable, relatively fast connection to be able to respond to ping requests to avoid being booted off the network. We recommend 2GB of RAM to cope with running the software reliably ( Note: This requirement may be much greater once services are live ). 1GB is fine for testing. At Least a 20GB SSD or Hard disk drive, this will be used to store the blockchain ( Note: to future proof yourself against blockchain growth and message storage we recommend a 30 - 40 GB drive ). A stable power supply. If your server goes down during the staking period, you may get kicked off the network, and not receive rewards while your funds are still locked for the remainder of the staking period. For most users, we assume that your home internet connection is relatively slow (< 4MB/s down and up) and probably lacks support for external connections. If this is the case, you will probably not want to run a Service Node from your home in the long term, as this could cost you if and when you get booted off. Since we\u2019re just testing at the moment, you could run it from home anyway, but for this guide we\u2019ll avoid it. Typically, the easiest and cheapest way to host a server outside of your home is to use a Virtual Private Server (VPS). There are thousands of options when it comes to VPS providers, but for now, just about any one will do. In the future, selection will be made more difficult because most providers will not allow exit node traffic, so we have compiled a list of exit node friendly providers to choose from if you want to stay with your provider for more than a few months. Hosting Provider Product Name Cost Per Month $USD Bandwidth Provided Exit Friendliness Rating Netcup VPS 1000 G8 10.50 30 - 35 MiB\u2019s 5 / 10 Online.net Start-2-S-SSD 13.99 15 - 17 MiB\u2019s 9 / 10 Scaleway START1-M 9.33 20 - 25 MiB\u2019s 7 / 10 OVH VPS SSD 2 7.61 9 - 1 MiB\u2019s 9 / 10 Leaseweb Virtual Server XL 34.45 30 - 35 MiB\u2019s 5 / 10 Digital Ocean 2 GB, 2 vCPUs 15 9 - 11 MiB\u2019s 8 / 10 Feral Hosting Neon Capability 19.68 9 - 11 MiB\u2019s 9 / 10 Trabia VDS-8G 38.54 9 - 11 MiB\u2019s 8 / 10 Hetzner EX41-SSD (30 TB) 39.71 40 - 80 MiB\u2019s 4 / 10 Note: We do not officially endorse any of these providers, this list is simply illustrative of some of the options currently available* Try not to pick the first one off the list. Do some digging and see which one looks the best to you, what your budget is, and what the latency is like for you based on the server location that you choose. When selecting your VPS\u2019 operating system, choose Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit or Ubuntu 18.04 64 bit if you want to follow this guide. If you feel more confident or wish to run your server on another distribution or operating system, the Loki commands in this guide will still apply. Step 2 - Prepare your Server \u00b6 Every provider has a slightly different way of issuing you access to your new VPS. Most will send an email with the IP address, root username, and a root password of the VPS. To access your server, you will need a SSH client for your operating system. Because we\u2019re on Windows today, we\u2019ll download PuTTY, Mac users can also use PuTTY. If you\u2019re a Linux user, you probably don\u2019t want us telling you where to get a SSH client from. To connect to our VPS we will need to paste the IP address into the SSH client\u2019s \u201cHost Name (or IP address)\u201d input box and click the \u201cOpen\u201d button. The Port number can usually just be left as 22 . A terminal window will now appear prompting for your log-in details, username(root) and password, which were provided by your VPS provider. When entering your password, nothing will visually appear in the terminal. This is normal. Hit enter when it\u2019s typed or pasted, and you should be logged in to your VPS. Create a non-root User \u00b6 Best practice when running a public server is to not run your software as the root user. Although it is possible to do everything as root, it is strongly recommended that you create a non-root user on our VPS by running the following command: adduser <username> Replacing <username> with a name you will log-in with. For this user-guide we will use snode as our username. adduser snode The terminal will prompt you for a new password for our newly created user. Use a secure password that is different password from the root password. Once the password has been set, the terminal will prompt for a few details about the individual running the user. You can just hit enter through each of the inputs as the details are not important for the purposes of running a Service Node. Once that\u2019s done, run the following two commands to give our new account admin privileges and to change to such account. usermod -aG sudo snode su - snode Before we proceed further, it is advised to close your terminal and reopen PuTTY to set up a saved session with our snode user. Your SSH client will have a load and save session function. For PuTTY we will need to type in our VPS IP address again, on the same screen type snode under \u201cSaved Session\u201d. Click on \u201cData\u201d under the drop-down menu \u201cConnection\u201d, and type in snode (or your username defined before) into the input box \u201cAuto-login username\u201d. Go back to your session screen, where we entered the IP address, and click \u201cSave\u201d. You can load this session whenever you want to check on your Service Node. Hot Tips for using the Console \u00b6 Consoles don't work like the rest of your computer. Here are some basic tips for navigating your way around the command line! Don't try copying something by using the usual Ctrl + C hotkey! If you want to copy something, do so by highlighting text and then right clicking it. Pasting works by right clicking a blank area in the console. If you want to kill a process or stop something from running, press Ctrl + C. (This is why you shouldn't try copying something with this hotkey.) You can always check the directory you are in by typing pwd and list its contents by typing ls . You can always return to your home directory by typing cd . You can move into a given directory by typing cd <name> or move back up one level by typing cd .. . PuTTY allows you to easily duplicate or restart a session by right clicking the top of the window. Handy if you\u2019re trying to do a few things at once. Once we have logged in correctly to the VPS for the first time, the VPS may be configured to prompt for a new password for the root account. The terminal will require you to enter the new password twice before we can start running commands. If you aren't prompted for a new root password but want to change it anyway, type sudo passwd . Choose something very secure! Server Preparation Continued \u00b6 We should update our package lists, the below command downloads the package lists from the repositories and \"updates\" them to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies. It will do this for all repositories and PPAs. sudo apt update You will notice a bunch of package lists were downloaded, once this is complete run the below command to fetch new versions of any packages we currently have installed on the system. sudo apt upgrade You will be prompted to authorise the use of disk space, type y and enter to authorise. If you are prompted during the upgrade that a new version of any file is available then click the up and down arrows until you are hovering over install the package maintainer\u2019s version and click enter. Alright, good to go. Our server is now set up, up to date, and is not running as root. On to the fun part! Step 3 - Download the Loki Binaries \u00b6 In order to download and extract the Linux binaries, we need to make sure a couple tools are installed: sudo apt install wget unzip Now download the Linux binaries by running the following command: wget <link> Where <link> is the download link of the latest linux release. To find the link go to https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases/latest , right click the latest linux release and click Copy Link Location . 3.1 - Lokid Binaries \u00b6 To download the lokid binaries run the following command: wget https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases/download/vX.X.X/loki-linux-x64-vX.X.X.tar.xz Replacing X.X.X with the latest binary version number from https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases/latest . 3.2 - Storage Server Binaries \u00b6 To download the loki storage server binaries run the following command: wget https://github.com/loki-project/loki-storage-server/releases/download/vX.X.X/loki-storage-linux-x64-vX.X.X.tar.xz Replacing X.X.X with the latest binary version number from https://github.com/loki-project/loki-storage-server/releases . 3.3 - Untar Binaries \u00b6 To untar the downloaded files run the following command: tar -xvf <filename> Replacing <filename> with the the filename we downloaded. For this example we would run 2 commands: tar -xvf loki-linux-x64-vX.X.X.tar.xz tar -xvf loki-storage-linux-x64-vX.X.X.tar.xz 3.4 - Create Symlink \u00b6 Note you need to replace the vX.X.X with the version you downloaded previous otherwise the symlink will not work. We now want to create a \"symlink\" to the extracted loki-linux-x64-vX.X.X folder: ln -snf loki-linux-x64-vX.X.X loki and a \"symlink\" to the extracted loki-storage-linux-x64-vX.X.X folder: ln -snf loki-storage-linux-x64-vX.X.X loki-ss This creates a virtual folder that points to the binary folders. This isn't strictly necessary, but will help with upgrades in the future: when you want to upgrade you can just repeat everything in this step again with the new binaries. Excellent! We now have all of the necessary files to get this show on the road! NOTE: If you\u2019re nervous about trusting the binaries or the download link, you should build it from source yourself. Instructions for that can be found in the README of https://github.com/loki-project/loki Step 4 - Service Node as a Service \u00b6 At this point you can run the Loki binaries directly in your terminal, but this is not a viable approach to running it as a service node: when you close PuTTY the program running inside it will also shut down, which is no good for a service node. Instead we will configure the Loki daemons as a system service which makes it automatically start up if the server reboots, and restarts it automatically if it crashes for some reason. 4.1 lokid.service file \u00b6 Create the lokid.service file: sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lokid.service Copy the text below and paste it into your new file: [Unit] Description=lokid service node After=network-online.target [Service] Type=simple User=snode ExecStart=/home/snode/loki/lokid --non-interactive --service-node --service-node-public-ip SERVERIP --storage-server-port 23023 Restart=always RestartSec=30s [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Replacing SERVERIP in the line ExecStart= with your servers IP. To find your SERVERIP run the command curl ifconfig.me If you chose a username other than snode then change snode in the User= and ExecStart= lines to the alternative username. (If you want to run a testnet service node, append --testnet to the end of the ExecStart line. Alternatively, if you want to be able to run both a testnet and mainnet service node simultaneously you can use two service files: lokid.service and lokid-testnet.service and add --testnet to the ExecStart= line in the latter. You would then use lokid-testnet.service instead of lokid.service in the commands below when you want to control the testnet service node.) Once completed, save the file and quit nano: CTRL+X -> Y -> ENTER. 4.2 loki-ss.service file \u00b6 Create the loki-ss.service file: sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/loki-ss.service Copy the text below and paste it into your new file: [Unit] Description=Loki storage server After=network-online.target Requires=lokid.service [Service] User=snode Type=simple WorkingDirectory=/home/snode Restart=always RestartSec=5s ExecStart=/home/snode/loki-storage 0.0.0.0 23023 --lokid-rpc-port 22023 --lokid-key /home/snode/.loki/key [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target If you chose a username other than snode then change snode in the User= and ExecStart= lines to the alternative username. Once completed, save the file and quit nano: CTRL+X -> Y -> ENTER. 4.3 Enabling Service Files \u00b6 Reload systemd manager configuration (to make it re-read the new service file): sudo systemctl daemon-reload Enable lokid.service so that it starts automatically upon boot: sudo systemctl enable lokid.service loki-ss.service Start lokid.service: sudo systemctl start lokid.service loki-ss.service The daemon will now start syncing. You won\u2019t be able to do much if it hasn\u2019t synced. To see the progress of your lokid service file you can run the following command: sudo journalctl -u lokid.service -af You should see it syncing the blockchain. To see the progress of your loki-ss service file you can run the following command: sudo journalctl -u loki-ss.service -af Step 5 - Get/Open A Wallet \u00b6 While we wait for the daemon to sync, we can now get a wallet going. You do not have to run this wallet on the server and you should not! Download the software and run it from elsewhere for security reasons! You can run the CLI wallet (Command Line Interface wallet) on any other computer, including your home computer to avoid leaving your wallet on the server. However, if you do want to run the CLI wallet on another computer, you will either need to run another daemon on that local machine or use a remote node (uk.loki.cash:22020, for example). There is also a list of trusted remote nodes in the Loki Project Discord channel under #links-and-resources. ./loki-wallet-cli --daemon-address <insert address here> Or on windows: loki-wallet-cli.exe --daemon-address <insert address here> If you are made of money and are willing to take the small risk of losing all of your funds, you can continue running the wallet inside the Service Node VPS. So we don't have to talk about a myriad of other operating systems or potential user cases, the rest of this guide will assume you are running the wallet in the same VPS. As such, it\u2019ll probably save us time to open a second PuTTY session. You can do this by right clicking the window of the current PuTTY session and clicking \u201cDuplicate Session.\u201d Log in as the non-root user that we set up before, in our case snode , and launch the wallet using: ~/loki/loki-wallet-cli If you are on testnet run the command with the --testnet flag: ~/loki/loki-wallet-cli --testnet When loki-wallet-cli first runs, it will request for you to specify a wallet name. Assuming we haven't created one yet, we will use the e.g. name MyWallet Because this is the first time we have used the name MyWallet the client will prompt us to create a new wallet. Type y and click return to continue. The loki-wallet-cli has generated us a wallet called MyWallet and is now prompting us for a password. Note: When typing the password, the characters will not appear. It will seem as if you are typing and no text is appearing however the terminal is logging every character you type including if it is capitalised or lowercase. Write down your wallet name and password on a piece of paper as this information will be required every time we want to enter our wallet. Use a password with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols and make the password at least 9 characters long. Once we have chosen our password for the wallet we must choose our language. For the purposes of this user guide I suggest you use English by typing in 1 and clicking return. The CLI will generate and spit out several lines of text. The first two lines of text show your wallet public address. This address can be shared, will be used to receive Loki to your wallet, and will be used during the preparation and registration of our Service Node. All Mainnet Loki public addresses start with an L and are followed with a string of characters, Testnet Public addresses start with a T. The public address shown will be your primary address, however multiple public addresses can be generated from this primary address. Line 13 to 17 show your 25-word mnemonic (\u201cnew-monic\u201d) seed. The seed is used to easily backup and restore your wallet without needing any other information. At this stage, grab a pen and paper, and write down your 25 words in order. Store the piece of paper in a safe and secure place, if your words are stored in a text file on your computer or stored online, you increase your risk of someone else getting control of your wallet. It is at this point that we should get some Loki in the wallet. The amount of Loki required to run a node is derived from the function shown in Lokis Cryptoeconomic paper . Don't worry if you cant work out the formula, you can use this community created tool or, the daemon will display the amount of Loki required to run the node. If you do not have enough you will have the option to join in or run your own Service Node pool. If you are running a Service Node on the testnet you will only ever require 100 testnet Loki to run the Node. You can ask the Telegram @LokiSNBot for some testnet loki or ask someone in the Loki Discord Community for some. If you are staking please do not use Subaddresses. They are currently unsupported by the Loki wallet. We will need our address to register our Service Node later, to get your primary address type the following command: address Highlight the string of characters that were outputted and save this in a notepad for later use, your public address should look similar to: T6TCCyDgjjbddtzwNGryRJ5HntgGYvqZTagBb2mtHhn7WWz7i5JDeqhFiHqu7ret56411ZJS7Thfeis718bVteBZ2UA6Y7G2d (Note that this is an example testnet wallet address; your address will start with L if it is a mainnet wallet) NOTE: Do not use CTRL + C to copy your address, it will close the wallet down. Simply highlight the address and this will automatically save the portion you highlighted into your clipboard. Once you have enough Loki in this wallet, just leave it open, we\u2019ll come back to it in a minute. Step 6 - Service Node Registration \u00b6 The next part of the guide will split into two sections: If you are an individual staker and do not require any other contributors to run your Service Node jump into 6.1 - individual Staking . If you want to run a pooled Service Node or contribute towards a pool jump into 6.2 - Pool Staking 6.1 - Individual Staking \u00b6 If you want to run the Service Node as an individual you will require the following things. A fully synchronized, up-to-date Loki daemon running with the --service-node flag (see step 4). A loki-wallet-cli primary address with enough Loki in your account to meet the Service Node Staking Requirement (see step 5). Now if we have the two above items we can proceed to our daemon to register our Service Node. Log in (if not already connected) as the snode user on the VPS running the service node, then start the registration process by running the following interactive command: ~/loki/lokid prepare_registration The daemon will output the current staking requirement and prompt you with an input to clarify whether you are an individual staker or you will be running a pool. Type y and click enter as we will be the sole staker. The daemon will now prompt us for the Loki address of the operator. If you followed step 5 you should have this address saved in a notepad, if not run through step 5 again to find your Loki Address. Once we have the Loki Address copied to our clipboard we can then right click the terminal screen to paste the address.

Copy the whole line of text and paste it into your notepad as we will need to run this command in our loki-wallet-cli . If registering multiple nodes, it will likely be necessary to wait at least 10 blocks between Service Nodes before running the register Service Node command in the wallet. You have 2 weeks from the moment of preparing the registration command on the Service Node to actually run the register_service_node command in the wallet, however it is advised to do it as soon as possible. Run through step 5 once more to open our Loki wallet (if you don't already have it open). Once we are in our wallet run the command the daemon outputted for us when we prepared our Service Node registration. The wallet will prompt us to confirm our password, then the amount of Loki to stake. Confirm this by typing y and clicking enter. Note: At this point you now have locked stakes! To unlock your stake run the following Well done! Let's continue to the next step \"Step 7 - Service Node Check\" to check if our Service Node is running. 6.2 - Pool Staking \u00b6 Minimum Contribution Rules \u00b6 Infinite Staking introduces new limitations on the number of transactions that can be contributed to a Service Node, changing the minimum contribution rules for participating in the Service Node. Service Nodes accept at most 4 contributions, meaning the minimum contribution to a Service Node becomes: In a pooled Service Node with reserved spots, the Minimum Contribution must be either the Reserved Amount or the Contribution determined by the above equation, whichever is larger. A simplistic example being, if the staking requirement is 24,000 Loki then if, Operator contributes 50% of the requirement (12,000 Loki) The next contributor must contribute at least (\u2153 * 12,000) Loki i.e. 4000 Loki to become a participant. If this contributor had reserved a spot for more than 4000 Loki, their Minimum Contribution would be that amount. There are rules in the client software in place to stop users from irreversibly funding a Service Node into an invalid state. Depending on the individual and their circumstance they will need to: Jump into section 6.2.1 - Operator if they are running the daemon and hosting the pool; Jump into section 6.2.2 - Pool Contributor if they are contributing to someone's Service Node. NOTE: It is advised to read both sections of \"6.2 - Pool Staking\" to have a better understanding of the process. 6.2.1 - Operator \u00b6 The Operator is the individual who will be hosting the pool and running the Service Node daemon, thus incurring the operating expenses encompassed by running a node. The Operator will need to have: A fully synchronized, up-to-date Loki daemon running with the --service-node flag (see step 4) at all times. A loki-wallet-cli primary address with enough Loki in their account to meet 25% of the Staking Requirement. 1-3 other contributors who also have a wallet ( loki-wallet-cli or the desktop GUI wallet) with enough Loki in their accounts to meet 25% of the staking requirement. If the operator wants to reserve contribution spots for specific contributors: The address and contribution amounts the 1-3 contributors will stake. NOTE: The other contributors addresses are optional to have as you can create your pool to be open to anyone to contribute to, however they are recommended to have to avoid any issues of other individuals stealing their spots. On the other hand, a reserved contribution spot can only be filled by that contributor: if they change their mind before submitting a stake your service node will be stuck inactive, so it is recommended to use reserved contribution spots only with contributors you trust. Now if we have the three/four above items we can proceed to our daemon to register our Service Node. Log in (if not already connected) as the snode user on the VPS running the service node, then start the registration process by running the following interactive command: ~/loki/lokid prepare_registration The terminal will prompt the operator to specify if they will contribute the entire stake, because we are running this as a pooled Service Node we will type n and click enter. Next the terminal will request the input for the operator cut. This value is between 0-100 and represents the percentage of the reward the operator will receive before the reward is distributor to the share holders. If you have agreed to a 10% operator cut with the other contributors you would type 10 and click return. The terminal will now display the minimum reserve the operator can contribute and request the operator to input the amount in Loki they wish to contribute. Type your desired <operator contribution> and click return. Once we have set the operators desired stake amount we have the option to either leave the pool open for anyone to contribute or lock a reserve for individuals that have agreed with us to stake within our Service Node. Reserved Pool \u00b6 If the operator wishes to reserve spots for specific contributors they should type y and click return. The terminal will now prompt the operator for the number of additional contributors they have organised to be apart of this Service Node. Type in the number of reserved contributors, not including themselves, and click return. The daemon will now prompt us for the Loki address of the operator. If you followed step 5 you should have this address saved in a notepad, if not run through step 5 again to find your address. Once we have the Loki Address copied to our clipboard we can then right click the terminal screen to paste the address then click return to confirm your address. Next the operator must input the amount of Loki each contributor will contribute and the contributor's address. NOTE: It is possible to reserve only some of the required stakes for specific contributors while leaving the remaining stake open. You will now be asked to confirm the information above is correct. Open Pool \u00b6 If the operator wishes to leave their pool complete open to contributions they should type n and click return. The terminal will prompt the operator to input their address. Once the address has been inputted the terminal will display the remaining portion that needs to be contributed by others. If you agree click y and hit return. The daemon will display a summary of the information we entered. This is our chance for a final check over to make sure we entered in the right information. If you confirm the information is correct type y and click return. The daemon will output a command for us to run within our wallet, looking similar to: register_service_node 214748364 T6UCEoWvJHCJq5biK3LMQZ4CRXAaqiPda2kCRRYYYEMFfxYoqnUo7Nx88RL3wmENwN4kfjDSp2jMN1g6PSErKrSu2EEp8UMy5 1073741823 T6TCCyDgjjbddtzwNGryRJ5HntgGYvqZTagBb2mtHhn7WWz7i5JDeqhFiHqu7ret56411ZJS7Thfeis718bVteBZ2UA6Y7G2d 3221225469 25.000000000 1535692249 5dac247e90ced2dcd9e51faec8792acb0c11b4c700640d9104b17c868ea167e3 cc11eef804c11d3e93cf8c488c10d97b8cec9ee2b38e6666ff07749c2911aa06ce310edc926a4d2f50a588e9c15afcc20e935a0f188aa7caa764a62058dec80d NOTE: You must run the command outputed by your daemon and not the command shown above. Copy the whole line of text in your daemon and paste it into your notepad as we will need to run this command in our loki-wallet-cli . You have 2 weeks from the moment of registering the Service Node to run the register_service_node command, however it is advised to do it as soon as possible. Before you disconnect from your VPS run the following command to get your <Service Node Public Key> and save it in your notepad (your contributors will need it): ~/loki/lokid print_sn_key Run through step 5 once more to open our Loki wallet. Once we are in our wallet run the command the daemon outputted for us when we prepared our Service Node. The wallet will prompt us to confirm our password, then the amount of Loki to stake. Confirm this by typing y and clicking enter. Once this command completes your staking transaction will be sent to be included on the blockchain. It may take a few minutes for the transaction to be mined into a block; you can check the status using ~/loki/lokid print_sn_status or by looking for your <Service Node Public Key> in the \"Service Nodes Awaiting\" section on lokiblocks.com (or lokitestnet.com for a testnet service node). Once the service node registration is received you can send the <Service Node Public Key> to your contributors with the amount of Loki they are required to stake. NOTE: the final amount will typically be slightly lower than what you entered in the prepare_registration command. This is expected: the required amounts are based on the registration block height which has usually advanced by a couple blocks between the time you prepared the registration and the time it gets mined into the blockchain. At this point we will need to wait until all contributors have staked before the service node activates and becomes eligible to receive rewards. 6.2.2 - Pool Contributor \u00b6 The pool contributor must first receive the Service Node Pubkey and the requirements (amount of loki to send) from the Service Node Operator. If you are staking please do not use Subaddresses. They are currently unsupported by the Loki wallet The pool contributor must have downloaded the necessary binaries, is running a daemon or is connected to a remote node, has generated a wallet through either the loki-wallet-cli or the desktop GUI wallet, and has enough Loki to stake. They can then run the following command in their loki-wallet-cli . stake <Service Node Pubkey> <contribution amount> Where the <Service Node Pubkey> is the Pubkey provided from the Service Node operator and <contribution amount> is the amount of Loki they are going to stake which they agreed to with the Service Node Operator. If using the desktop GUI wallet, the Stake command can be found under the Advanced - Service Node menu. Enter the service <Service Node Pubkey> and <contribution amount> and hit the Stake button. At this stage you will need to wait for the other contributors to provide their collateral. Once everyone has staked you can refer to \u201cStep 7 - Service Node Check\u201d to see where your Service Node Operator\u2019s node is in the list. Congratulations, you are now staking. Step 7 - Service Node Check \u00b6 After we have locked our collateral we will need to check if our Service Node Pubkey is sitting in the list with the other Service Node\u2019s on the network. This will prove our Service Node is running, recognised and will receive a reward if it keeps running. Connect to the VPS where the service node is running and run the following command to see our Service Node Public Key: ~/loki/lokid print_sn_key The Service Node Public Key is used to identify our Service Node within the list of Service Nodes currently on the network. If you want more detailed Service Node status you can use the follow command: ~/loki/lokid print_sn_status You can jump onto https://lokiblocks.com/ to see if your Service Node is in the list or we can continue in the terminal to output the same information. If you are running your Service Node on testnet go to https://lokitestnet.com/ instead. To check this information directly with the service node itself, first get the current block height by running ~/loki/lokid status into the terminal: it will output this information. Once we have the block height we can then check the current Service Nodes on the network at our specified block height. Run the command ~/loki/lokid print_quorum_state <block height> replacing <block height> with the number minus 1 that was outputted when running status command. If your <Service Node Pubkey> is sitting in the list you know you are now staking. Step 8 - Unlock Stake \u00b6 Service Nodes will continually receive block rewards indefinitely until a stake is unlocked or the Service Node becomes deregistered. Unlocking is available via the following command which needs to be run in the command line wallet: request_stake_unlock <service node key> Once the unlock is requested and the request is included in a block in the blockchain, the Service Node will then expire in 15 days (10800 blocks) and the funds will become unlocked after expiry. In pooled nodes, any contributor that requests the stake to unlock will schedule the Service Node for expiration. All locked stakes in that Service Node will be unlocked in 15 days (10800 blocks). Once the unlock is requested, this process can not be undone or prolonged. Service Node participants will continue receiving rewards until expiration. Deregistrations can be issued at any point during the active lifecycle of the Service Node. This is inclusive of the time period during which the Service Node is scheduled for expiry. Getting deregistered removes your Service Node from the network and your stakes are placed into a list of blacklisted transactions. Blacklisted transactions are locked and unspendable for 30 days (21600 blocks) from the block in which the Service Node was deregistered. Receiving a deregistration after participants have already requested the stake to unlock overrides the 15 day (10800 blocks) unlock time, and resets the unlock time to 30 days (21600 blocks). Optional \u00b6 See Locked Stake Amount and Duration \u00b6 We can also view our locked stake by running the following command from our loki-wallet-cli we staked from: print_locked_stakes Express Setup Guide \u00b6 This section is for power users who are more familiar with servers and the CLI interface. There's a couple of things your going to want to do before you commence. 1. Get a Server that meets requirements 2. Run the Daemon on a server from a non-root user account, then stake from a local wallet (or a wallet on a separate server). Where <VERSION> is mentioned replace with the latest version for lokid and Storage Server , example v3.0.6 . 3. Connect via SSH to your server 4. add new user sudo adduser snode usermod -aG sudo snode 5. login to your new user account via SSH snode@<ipaddress> 6.

Let\u2019s get started. Choosing where to set up a Service Node is the biggest choice you will make when running a Service Node. There are a number of things to consider. Because you will be locking up funds for 30 days (2 days for testnet) at a time, you will want to ensure that your server has: A stable, relatively fast connection to be able to respond to ping requests to avoid being booted off the network. We recommend 2GB of RAM to cope with running the software reliably ( Note: This requirement may be much greater once services are live ). 1GB is fine for testing. At Least a 20GB SSD or Hard disk drive, this will be used to store the blockchain ( Note: to future proof yourself against blockchain growth and message storage we recommend a 30 - 40 GB drive ). A stable power supply. If your server goes down during the staking period, you may get kicked off the network, and not receive rewards while your funds are still locked for the remainder of the staking period. For most users, we assume that your home internet connection is relatively slow (< 4MB/s down and up) and probably lacks support for external connections. If this is the case, you will probably not want to run a Service Node from your home in the long term, as this could cost you if and when you get booted off. Since we\u2019re just testing at the moment, you could run it from home anyway, but for this guide we\u2019ll avoid it. Typically, the easiest and cheapest way to host a server outside of your home is to use a Virtual Private Server (VPS). There are thousands of options when it comes to VPS providers, but for now, just about any one will do. In the future, selection will be made more difficult because most providers will not allow exit node traffic, so we have compiled a list of exit node friendly providers to choose from if you want to stay with your provider for more than a few months.

You do not have to run this wallet on the server and you should not! Download the software and run it from elsewhere for security reasons! You can run the CLI wallet (Command Line Interface wallet) on any other computer, including your home computer to avoid leaving your wallet on the server. However, if you do want to run the CLI wallet on another computer, you will either need to run another daemon on that local machine or use a remote node (uk.loki.cash:22020, for example). There is also a list of trusted remote nodes in the Loki Project Discord channel under #links-and-resources. ./loki-wallet-cli --daemon-address <insert address here> Or on windows: loki-wallet-cli.exe --daemon-address <insert address here> If you are made of money and are willing to take the small risk of losing all of your funds, you can continue running the wallet inside the Service Node VPS. So we don't have to talk about a myriad of other operating systems or potential user cases, the rest of this guide will assume you are running the wallet in the same VPS. As such, it\u2019ll probably save us time to open a second PuTTY session. You can do this by right clicking the window of the current PuTTY session and clicking \u201cDuplicate Session.\u201d Log in as the non-root user that we set up before, in our case snode , and launch the wallet using: ~/loki/loki-wallet-cli If you are on testnet run the command with the --testnet flag: ~/loki/loki-wallet-cli --testnet When loki-wallet-cli first runs, it will request for you to specify a wallet name. Assuming we haven't created one yet, we will use the e.g. name MyWallet Because this is the first time we have used the name MyWallet the client will prompt us to create a new wallet. Type y and click return to continue. The loki-wallet-cli has generated us a wallet called MyWallet and is now prompting us for a password. Note: When typing the password, the characters will not appear. It will seem as if you are typing and no text is appearing however the terminal is logging every character you type including if it is capitalised or lowercase. Write down your wallet name and password on a piece of paper as this information will be required every time we want to enter our wallet. Use a password with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols and make the password at least 9 characters long. Once we have chosen our password for the wallet we must choose our language. For the purposes of this user guide I suggest you use English by typing in 1 and clicking return. The CLI will generate and spit out several lines of text. The first two lines of text show your wallet public address. This address can be shared, will be used to receive Loki to your wallet, and will be used during the preparation and registration of our Service Node. All Mainnet Loki public addresses start with an L and are followed with a string of characters, Testnet Public addresses start with a T. The public address shown will be your primary address, however multiple public addresses can be generated from this primary address. Line 13 to 17 show your 25-word mnemonic (\u201cnew-monic\u201d) seed. The seed is used to easily backup and restore your wallet without needing any other information. At this stage, grab a pen and paper, and write down your 25 words in order. Store the piece of paper in a safe and secure place, if your words are stored in a text file on your computer or stored online, you increase your risk of someone else getting control of your wallet. It is at this point that we should get some Loki in the wallet. The amount of Loki required to run a node is derived from the function shown in Lokis Cryptoeconomic paper . Don't worry if you cant work out the formula, you can use this community created tool or, the daemon will display the amount of Loki required to run the node. If you do not have enough you will have the option to join in or run your own Service Node pool. If you are running a Service Node on the testnet you will only ever require 100 testnet Loki to run the Node. You can ask the Telegram @LokiSNBot for some testnet loki or ask someone in the Loki Discord Community for some. If you are staking please do not use Subaddresses. They are currently unsupported by the Loki wallet. We will need our address to register our Service Node later, to get your primary address type the following command: address Highlight the string of characters that were outputted and save this in a notepad for later use, your public address should look similar to: T6TCCyDgjjbddtzwNGryRJ5HntgGYvqZTagBb2mtHhn7WWz7i5JDeqhFiHqu7ret56411ZJS7Thfeis718bVteBZ2UA6Y7G2d (Note that this is an example testnet wallet address; your address will start with L if it is a mainnet wallet) NOTE: Do not use CTRL + C to copy your address, it will close the wallet down.

The resulting network provides market-based resistance to Sybil attacks , addressing a range of problems with existing mixnets and privacy-centric services. This resistance is based on supply and demand interactions which help prevent single actors from having a large enough stake in Loki to have a significant negative impact on the second-layer privacy services Loki provides. DASH first theorised that Sybil attack resistant networks can be derived from cryptoeconomics. As an attacker accumulates Loki, the circulating supply decreases, in turn applying demand-side pressure, driving the price of Loki up. As this continues, it becomes increasingly costly for additional Loki to be purchased, making the attack prohibitively expensive. To achieve this economic protection, Loki encourages the active suppression of the circulating supply. In particular, the emissions curve and collateral requirements must be designed to ensure enough circulating supply is locked and reasonable returns are provided for operators to ensure Sybil attack resistance . Methods to Setup a Loki Service Node \u00b6 We support three different mechanisms of managing the loki service node suite: Method Description Loki Launcher Using loki-launcher to download, start, monitor, and manage service node components. Has built-in updating capabilities for new releases. Requires nodejs. Apt Repository Installing debs via apt repository which installs and runs the components via systemd. Updates via the system package manager(apt). Requires Ubuntu or Debian. Installing and Configuring Manually Installing and configuring manually. This is more involved than the above, and requires manual configurating and updating of each component. Service Node Activities \u00b6 Right now Service Nodes are full nodes on the Loki network. Full nodes become Service Nodes when the owner locks the required amount of Loki and submits a registration transaction. Once accepted by the network, the Service Node is eligible to win block rewards . Multiple participants can be involved in one Service Node and can have the reward automatically distributed. It is also worth noting that Service Nodes are quite basic at the moment, and operators will need to stay up to date with new updates to keep in line with software and hardware requirements. Once all of the updates are out, Service Nodes will also offer the following Loki Services : Route end user\u2019s internet traffic, either as an exit node or relay in a novel mixnet Receive, store and forward encrypted user messages Monitor other Service Nodes and vote on their performance Be called into quorums which give them authority over instant transactions ( Blink ) Act as remote nodes for users Once these features come out, Service Node operation will require better servers, particularly when it comes to bandwidth.

In Bitcoin and Ethereum, users can choose to connect to a public full node that holds a copy of the blockchain and can query and submit transactions to the network. This works because Bitcoin and Ethereum full nodes can efficiently search the blockchain for transactions that have the users public key as the target. Due to the construction of CryptoNote currencies, public full nodes (called remote nodes) are put under much more stress. When a user connects to a remote node, they must temporarily download every block (upon wallet creation or since last checked block) to their local machine and check each transaction for a public transaction key which can be generated from the users private view key. This process can cause a significant performance impact on remote nodes. Considering that there is no reward for this service, it can dissuade users from operating syncing services for light clients. CryptoNote mobile wallets are often unreliable and sometimes have to switch between remote nodes multiple times before establishing a reliable connection to either scan the blockchain or to submit a transaction. Additionally, malicious remote node operators running one of the few popular nodes can record the IP address of users as they broadcast specific transactions. Although no information about the actual transaction is revealed by this attack, specific IP addresses can be linked with transactions which can then be used to establish a link to a real-world identity, compromising privacy. Loki circumvents these issues by requiring each Service Node to act as a remote node that can be used by general users. Service Nodes naturally lend themselves to this work as they already hold a full copy of the blockchain and form a widely distributed network of high bandwidth nodes. By using Service Nodes as remote nodes, there is an inherent financial limitation as to how much of the remote node network any given party can own, and therefore, how much data a malicious node operator can collect. Future Service Node Functions \u00b6 Exit Nodes \u00b6 Exit nodes allow users to make requests to the wider internet and return those requests through a mixnet . If used correctly, exit nodes allow users to browse the internet privately and without the users IP address being exposed to the server. Although the operation of exit nodes is essential to Loki\u2019s extended utility, forcing all Service Node operators to act as exit nodes could be detrimental. Acting as an exit node may expose the operator to legal risks, as users of the exit node may perform malicious activity whilst using it as a proxy. As exit nodes simply relay traffic from the internet to the end user, exit nodes often receive Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) requests or are often assumed to be the source of hacking attempts. Although in most jurisdictions safe harboring laws may protect exit node operators, internet service providers that carry Service Node traffic on their servers may fear legal risks and often cut off service to the exit node. Upon startup, a Service Node is assigned a relay flag and is restricted to routing packets within Lokinet, but never makes requests to the wider internet. An operator must opt-in if they wish to become an exit node, in doing so they demonstrate an understanding of the additional risks while also submitting to additional Swarm tests . Opting-in as an exit node affords an operator double the reward of a normal relay when selected for a block reward . This incentive is provided to ensure that exit node operators have sufficient financial incentives to operate exit nodes, helping to protect against Sybil attacks specifically targeted to take over the exit node network. This is a vulnerability which Tor suffers from due to its low ratio of exit nodes to relays.","title":"Service Node Functions"},{"location":"ServiceNodes/ServiceNodeFunctions/#service-node-functions","text":"","title":"Service Node Functions"},{"location":"ServiceNodes/ServiceNodeFunctions/#remote-nodes","text":"On any given cryptocurrency network, storing a full copy of the blockchain is not possible or practical for many users.

A staking requirement is the minimum amount of said cryptocoin that is required to stake. Service Node Staking Requirement \u00b6 A Loki staking Requirement is the collateral requirement an operator stakes through a time-locked output, which can be unlocked as per the contributor's request. Upon a request to unlock the funds they will stay locked for an additional 15 days where the contributor will still receive rewards. In the extra field of the transaction, the Service Node operator includes the Loki address which may receive Service Node rewards. This address will also be used as the public key for Service Node operations such as swarm voting. Before each node joins the Service Node network, other nodes must individually validate that the said nodes collateral outlay matches the required amount, as per the decreasing collateralisation requirement. If the node is offline for a reasonable time, its uptime proof will not be sent to the other nodes resulting in a deregister of the node. Deregistered nodes will have their collateral requirement locked for 30 days. The staking requirement started at 45,000 during Service Node launch (block height 101250), and was to descend non-linearly to ~10,000 by year 4 (block height 1036800).

Step 1 - Server Preparation \u00b6 1.1 Add new User \u00b6 adduser <username> Replacing <username> with a name you will log-in with. For this user-guide we will use snode as our username. adduser snode Once that\u2019s done, run the following two commands to give our new account admin privileges and to change to such account. usermod -aG sudo snode sudo su - snode 1.2 Update and Upgrade Server \u00b6 Run the two following commands to update and upgrade your server. sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade Step 2 - Loki Launcher \u00b6 2.1 - Install NodeJS and Loki Launcher \u00b6 In order to use the Loki Launcher we first need to install NodeJS. Run the following command: curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash - then run: sudo apt-get install -y nodejs Next we need to install the launcher with the following command: sudo npm install -g loki-launcher 2.2 - Setting up your loki-launcher for Service Node \u00b6 We now need to prequalify our server to be ready to run as a service node. To do so run the following command: loki-launcher prequal 2.2 - Configuring Launcher.ini \u00b6 Next let's set our config file to enable the storage server and to set our network to testnet. Create a folder for our launcher.ini file: sudo mkdir /etc/loki-launcher Next create the launcher.ini file: sudo nano /etc/loki-launcher/launcher.ini Paste the following into the launcher.ini file and save. [blockchain] network=test [storage] enabled=true 2.3 - Download Lokid binaries \u00b6 We will download the Loki binaries by running the following command: sudo loki-launcher download-binaries 2.4 - Start the Loki Launcher \u00b6 To start the loki launcher run the following command: sudo loki-launcher start At this moment the launcher will output a table showing if everything is working properly: \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 (index) \u2502 Values \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524 \u2502 launcher \u2502 'running as 16196' \u2502 \u2502 blockchain \u2502 'running as 16207' \u2502 \u2502 lokiKey \u2502 'found at /home/snode/.loki/testnet/key' \u2502 \u2502 storageServer \u2502 'running as 16208' \u2502 \u2502 socket \u2502 'running at /opt/loki-launcher/var' \u2502 \u2502 blockchain_rpc \u2502 'waiting...' \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 Now the Loki-launcher is running we can access the launcher by running the following command: sudo loki-launcher client To exit out of the client click CTRL + C . Note: Loki-launcher will run in the background now and continue to sync with the blockchain. The only problem is if the system reboots we will need to relaunch the loki-launcher software. We can fix this by configuring the Launcher as a system service which makes it automatically start up if the server reboots, and restarts it if the software crashes for some reason. Step 3 - Loki-Launcher as a System Service \u00b6 3.1 User permissions \u00b6 We are going to need to fix our user \"snode\"s permissions with the loki-launcher. To do: Skip for people running as root To do this we need to swap back to root: su - root Next run the following command: loki-launcher fix-perms <USER> Replacing <USER> with snode or the username that you created.

If you are using any screen's you will need kill the screens and go back to the Service Node Full Guide and follow it once more. Step 1: Load and Update your VPS. \u00b6 If you are updating your Service Node you would by now have a good understanding of how to log in to your server. If you don't check out how you prepared your server in this guide here . Once we have logged in to our VPS we should update our package lists, the below command downloads the package lists from the repositories and \"updates\" them to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies. It will do this for all repositories and PPAs. sudo apt update You will notice a bunch of package lists were downloaded, once this is complete run the below command to fetch new versions of any packages we currently have installed on the system. sudo apt upgrade You will be prompted to authorise the use of disk space, type y and enter to authorise. If you are prompted during the upgrade that a new version of any file is available then click the up and down arrows until you are hovering over install the package maintainer\u2019s version and click enter. Alright, good to go. Our server is now up to date. On to the fun part! Step 2: Install Node JS \u00b6 In order to use the Loki Launcher we first need to install NodeJS. Run the following command: curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash - then sudo apt-get install -y nodejs Step 3: Loki Launcher \u00b6 3.1 Install \u00b6 Run the following command to install loki-launcher sudo npm install -g loki-launcher 3.2 Download lokid binaries \u00b6 Now loki-launcher is installed we should download the lokid binary: sudo loki-launcher download-binaries 3.3 Fix loki-launcher permissions \u00b6 Let's change to root to make these changes: su - root Now while in root let's give our user snode the required permissions to run the loki-launcher. sudo loki-launcher fix-perms snode Now let's change back to user snode. su - snode Step 4: lokid.service file \u00b6 Next we're going to have to stop our lokid.service file and update it to launch the launcher instead of lokid. 4.1: Stop existing lokid.service file \u00b6 Stop your existing service node: sudo systemctl stop lokid.service 4.2 - Setting up your loki-launcher for Service Node \u00b6 We now need to prequalify our server to be ready to run as a service node. To do so run the following command: loki-launcher prequal In most cases this will let us know we are good to deploy our Service Node. Troubleshooting will be required at this point if an error message pops up. 4.3: Check-systemd \u00b6 Run the check-systemd to make systemd now launch the launcher instead of lokid: sudo loki-launcher check-systemd 4.4 Update Service file \u00b6 Make sure the service is up to date: sudo systemctl daemon-reload 4.5 Start the new lokid.service file \u00b6 sudo systemctl start lokid.service At this point it is wise to restart your system with the following command: sudo reboot Once the system has restarted it will reboot the new version of lokid.service . Log back in to your VPS and double check the new version of lokid.service is running smoothly by running the following command: sudo journalctl -u lokid.service -af You can now access your lokid daemon by running the following command: loki-launcher client This will allow you to parse commands into your daemon, for example: print_sn_key e.t.c.

Learn for what you are being paid \u00b6 By providing a unique subaddress for each anticipated payment you will know for what you are being paid. This use case overlaps with integrated addresses. Subaddresses are generally prefered for reasons outlined below. Prevent payer from linking your payouts together \u00b6 To prevent the payer from linking your payouts together simply generate a new subaddress for each payout. This way services like Shapeshift wouldn't know it is you again receving Loki. Note it won't help if you have an account with the service. Then your payouts are already linked in the service database, regardless of Loki. Group funds into accounts \u00b6 Note Feel free to skip this if your are new to Loki. Accounts are not essential and currently not supported by the GUI. Accounts are a convenience wallet-level feature to group subaddresses under one label and balance. You may want to organize your funds into accounts like \"cash\", \"work\", \"trading\", \"mining\", \"donations\", etc. As accounts are only groupings of subaddresses, they themselves do not have an address. Accounts are deterministically derived from the root private key along with subaddresses. As of September 2018 accounts are only supported by the CLI wallet and missing from GUI wallet. Accounts are similar to subaccounts in your classic bank account. There is a very important difference though. In Loki funds don't really sit on accounts or public addresses. Public addresses are conceptually a gateway or a routing mechanism. Funds sit on transactions' unspent outputs. Thus, a single transaction can - in principle - aggregate and spend outputs from multiple addresses (and by extension from multiple accounts). The CLI or GUI wallet may not directly support creating such transactions for simplicity. In short, think of accounts as a soft grouping of your funds. Why not multiple wallets? \u00b6 The advantage over creating multiple wallets is that you only have a single seed to manage. All subaddresses can be derived from the wallet seed. Additionally, you conveniently manage your subaddresses within a single user interface. Wallet level feature \u00b6 Subaddresses and accounts are a wallet-level feature to construct and interpret transactions. They do not affect the consensus. Data structure \u00b6 Subaddress has a dedicated \"network byte\": Index Size in bytes Description 0 1 identifies the network and address type; 116 - mainnet; 36 - stagenet; 158 - testnet Otherwise the data structure is the same as for the main address . Generating \u00b6 Each subaddress conceptually has: account index (also known as \"major\" index) subaddress index within the account (also known as \"minor\" index) The indexes are 0-based. By default wallets use account index 0. The indexes are not directly included in the subaddress data structure. Instead, they are used as input to generating subaddress keys. Private view key \u00b6 The subaddress private view key m is derived as follows: m = Hs(\"SubAddr\" || a || account_index || subaddress_index_within_account) Where: Hs is a Keccak-256 hash function interpreted as integer and modulo l (maximum edwards25519 scalar) || is a byte array concatenation operator SubAddr is a 0-terminated fixed string (8 bytes total) a is a private view key of the main address (a 32 byte little endian unsigned integer) account_index is index of an account (a 32 bit little endian unsigned integer) subaddress_index_within_account is index of the subaddress within the account (a 32 bit little endian unsigned integer) Deriving \"sub view keys\" from the main view key allows for creating a view only wallet that monitors the entire wallet including subaddresses. Public spend key \u00b6 The subaddress public spend key D is derived as follows: D = B + m*G Where: B is main address public spend key m is subaddress private view key G is the \"base point\"; this is simply a constant specific to edwards25519 Public view key \u00b6 The subaddress public view key C is derived as follows: C = a*D Where: a is a private view key of the main address D is a public spend key of the subaddress Special case for (0, 0) \u00b6 The subaddress #0 on the account #0 is the main address . As main address has different generation rules, this is simply implemented via an if statement. Building the address string \u00b6 The procedure is the same as for the main address . Caveats \u00b6 It is not recommended to sweep all the balances of subaddress to main address in a single transaction. That links the subaddresses together on the blockchain. However, this only concerns privacy against specific sender and the situation will never get worse than not using subaddresses in the first place. If you need to join funds while preserving maximum privacy do it with individual transactions (one per subaddress). Convenience labels are not preserved when recreating from seed.

It is best to use a brand-new wallet for the purpose, although not required. It is strongly advised to make a copy of the wallet files first, just in case something goes wrong. Overview \u00b6 In short, the process is: Set-up Both parties prepare loki-wallet-cli files Both parties command prepare_multisig and send data to each other Both parties command make_multisig Receiving All parties can type address to see the created multisig wallet address. The address will, of course, be the same for all parties since they're all watching the same wallet. Preparation for Sending To prepare for sending both parties command export_multisig_info <filename> and send the file to the other party To complete preparation, all parties command import_multisig_info <filename1> <filename2> and import files from other parties Sending To send, any party can use the usual transfer command, but the result will be a file named multisig_loki_tx which must be sent to any 1 other signer The other party commands sign_multisig multisig_loki_tx and the file is updated with the signature. The completely signed file is pushed to the network with use of submit_multisig multisig_loki_tx Below is a step-by-step walkthrough.

Send this line to person B through a private communication channel. Person B does the same and sends his output to person A. Person B must run the command in their loki-wallet-cli : prepare_multisig Person B will receive the output: MultisigV1BU9w9mysQMhNTYcNFQgD82VQiKFGpkwy8Jmu13iWWBmoeRbqyuYmEh22bJRk945ntuDeazTsYwUCYZcCL1cxuf4xDzwUJCLkiYhPCvF7gv3xrCGkAiozirNUG6CxRa53mHqp4Cvdj3yxcQcYbXNYC1ecybbQMW1gs5BBQiruVGeJi4FS Send this multisig info to all other participants, then use make_multisig <threshold> <info1> [<info2>...] with others' multisig info This includes the PRIVATE view key, so needs to be disclosed only to that multisig wallet's participants Person B will copy the Multisig\u2026...eJi4FS and send it to person A through a private communication channel. Step 2 Create Multisig Wallets \u00b6 Both person A and person B now have the Multisig...arg text from the other one. With that, each of them can create their part of the multisig wallet. Before you proceed, note that the wallet will lose access to the underlying account when converted to multisig. This is not really a problem, since we started with an empty one, and if all goes ok with this step, you won't ever need it unless you want to go through the process again for whatever reason (like HDD died, but you have the seed mnemonic of the underlying account and want to reconstruct the multisig wallet).

Receiving \u00b6 Step 1 Fund The Multisig Account \u00b6 This is simple. Just send to the shared address. You can send multiple times, this is the same as a normal wallet. You can use payment ID\u2019s as well, or generate an integrated address to receive funds. Best part, whomever is sending the funds won't be able to tell that the address belongs to a multisig wallet since it looks like any other. Step 2 Check Multisig Account Balance \u00b6 Just open the wallet and command refresh. Once completed, both persons can verify that the funds arrived. Person A commands: show_transfers Person A outputs: 1357156 in 07:50:35 PM 0.100000000000 88ba687dc79a0b39e6de6d0763eda8363d33d9f58ec9a096171bd9a7f1dae873 0000000000000000 - 1357161 in 08:00:18 PM 0.100000000000 d6ac845b9400759525519cdc5d514eb8f5b1d265b24d1c016e75b20ed3b4b7da 0000000000000000 - Person B can do the same: show_tranfers Person B has the same outputs: 1357156 in 07:50:35 PM 0.100000000000 88ba687dc79a0b39e6de6d0763eda8363d33d9f58ec9a096171bd9a7f1dae873 0000000000000000 - 1357161 in 08:00:18 PM 0.100000000000 d6ac845b9400759525519cdc5d514eb8f5b1d265b24d1c016e75b20ed3b4b7da 0000000000000000 - Spending \u00b6 Step 1 Synchronizing Key Images \u00b6 1.1 Exporting Multisig Info \u00b6 Without this step, it will not be possible to create a spending transaction. Both persons need to run the following command to sync their key images: export_multisig_info <filename> Where <filename> can be any filename. Person A will run the command: export_multisig_info mi1 Person A will receive the output: Multisig info exported to mi1 The file mi1 will be located in the shell working folder* Person A sends that file to Person B. They can send the file in many ways, preferably through by handing a usb drive with the file on it, however If you would like to send the file through terminal use https://transfer.sh/ , an optional step has been added if you choose to use this method. Person B does the same, but changing the filename and runs the command: export_multisig_info mi2 Person B will receive the output: Multisig info exported to mi2 The file mi2 will be located in the shell working folder* Person B sends that file to person A. Now, they must both import each other's file. Optional: Step 1.2 Sending Multisig Info File with terminal - transfer.sh \u00b6 It is optional to use the terminal to send each person the multisig info files. Uploading Multisig Info file \u00b6 Person A will open up a new terminal and change to the directory \u201cmi1\u201d has been saved.* Person A will run the following command: curl --upload-file ./mi1 https://transfer.sh/mi1 Person A will receive the link to the file as an output, looking similar to: https://transfer.sh/Ehl5q/mi1 Person A will need to send this link to Person B. Person B will run a similar command: curl --upload-file ./mi1 https://transfer.sh/mi2 Person B will receive the link to the file as an output, looking similar to: https://transfer.sh/Iedv9/mi2 Person B will need to send this link to Person A. Downloading Multisig Info file \u00b6 Person A should change to the directory of their loki-wallet-cli and use Person B\u2019s download link to run the command: curl <Person B link> -o <filename> Replacing <Person B link> with the link Person B shared with Person A and <filename> with the filename of the Multisig info file that Person A generated, for example Person A will run the command: curl https://transfer.sh/Iedv9/mi2 -o mi2 Likewise, Person B should do the same, changing directories to their loki-wallet-cli and downloading with Person A\u2019s download link, and filename. curl https://transfer.sh/Ehl5q/mi1 -o mi1 Step 1.3 Importing Multisig Info \u00b6 Person A will run the command: import_multisig_info mi2 Depending on the transactions made in to the multsig wallet the output will look similar to: 2 outputs found in mi2 Height 1357156, transaction <88ba687dc79a0b39e6de6d0763eda8363d33d9f58ec9a096171bd9a7f1dae873>, received 0.100000000000 Height 1357161, transaction <d6ac845b9400759525519cdc5d514eb8f5b1d265b24d1c016e75b20ed3b4b7da>, received 0.100000000000 Person B will run a similar command: import_multisig_info mi1 and the output will look like: 2 outputs found in mi1 Height 1357156, transaction <88ba687dc79a0b39e6de6d0763eda8363d33d9f58ec9a096171bd9a7f1dae873>, received 0.100000000000 Height 1357161, transaction <d6ac845b9400759525519cdc5d514eb8f5b1d265b24d1c016e75b20ed3b4b7da>, received 0.100000000000 Step 2 Preparing Spending Transaction \u00b6 Either person A or person B can do this, it doesn't matter. To avoid weird things from happening only do it for 1 transaction at a time. Person A performs the usual transfer command: transfer T6TmZX8EzZVjS9zNg7zAsrEQFDgcVC2qV2ZMyoWsbyK4SNB2SwMHZtMhPSsFyTmRBQUaGVF5k3qy5CMFM6Lvj7gi3AeszDag7 50 The output will look like: Unsigned transaction(s) successfully written to file: multisig_loki_tx Check in the folder where you started loki-wallet-cli from. There should be a file named multisig_loki_tx . Person A will send the file multisig_loki_tx to the Person B. Person A can send this file through email or alternatively use the transfer.sh commands outside of the wallet: curl --upload-file ./multisig_loki_tx https://transfer.sh/multisig_loki_tx If Person A chooses to use transfer.sh command to send the file to Person B they will receive a <link> to pass to Person B. Person B must finish the signature. Person B copies/downloads the file to the same folder from where he started (or will start) loki-wallet-cli . Person B can run the command to download the file to the loki-wallet-cli directory. curl https://transfer.sh/CJqnM/multisig_loki_tx -o multisig_loki_tx Replacing https://transfer.sh/CJqnM/multisig_loki_tx with the link provided by Person A. Then, Person B runs the command: sign_multisig multisig_loki_tx A prompt will be displayed to allow person B to check the transaction before signing: Loaded 1 transactions, for 108.082287779, fee 0.061108880, sending 50.000000000 to T6TmZX8EzZVjS9zNg7zAsrEQFDgcVC2qV2ZMyoWsbyK4SNB2SwMHZtMhPSsFyTmRBQUaGVF5k3qy5CMFM6Lvj7gi3AeszDag7, 58.021178899 change to T6ScXhWpAG2aUHmFemwvn4HddHA5GQ4u6MvYsW2hVteJSwLJXCEhk2aVp4XzyqGmvyUqc3w8fwWwg6szGEytUSx51C6WQ3er8, with min ring size 10, no payment ID.

Is this okay? (Y/Yes/N/No): If ok, answer Y , and the transaction will be sent. The output will look like: Transaction successfully submitted, transaction <3b03b16c79eaa5564171ae88242c4cdb1f9e0b41fc3de949c6524c5026a3f3bb> The person B could also send the signed TX to person A, who could then submit it to the network himself. If you want to make another one, you have to go back to step 1 of spending (sync the key images again). Note on folders and file locations, as it could create some confusions. The wallet will look for the files and export them to the folder from where it was started, ie where your command prompt / shell was when you called loki-wallet-cli . It may or may not be the same folder as your actual wallet files or loki-wallet-cli , depending on how you go about it. For example, your wallet could be on some USB drive like f:\\temp\\ , and your wallet software on c:\\loki-windows-x64\\ and your shell working folder could be c:\\ . If you remain in c:\\ with the shell, you could start the wallet by its full path and specify the wallet file location: c:\\loki-windows-x64\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file f:\\temp\\mywallet . In this case, all the import/export stuff would be read/written to c:\\ because that's still your shell's working folder. It would be probably feel more natural to cd into the wallet folder. Do f: to change drive and then cd f:\\temp\\ . Then, simply start the wallet from that location by its full path again: c:\\loki-windows-x64\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file mywallet . Notice how you don't have to write the full wallet path now as you're already there with your shell. In this case, all the files mentioned above would be written or read from the same folder as the wallet files.

It is best to use a brand-new wallet for the purpose, although not required. It is strongly advised to make a copy of the wallet files first, just in case something goes wrong. Overview \u00b6 In short, the process is: Wallet Creation All parties command prepare_multisig and send data to ALL other parties All parties command make_multisig <threshold> <data1> <data2> and send 2nd batch of data to ALL other parties All parties command finalize_multisig <data1> <data2> with the data from ALL other parties. Receiving All parties can type address to see the created multisig wallet address. The address will, of course, be the same for all parties since they're all watching the same wallet. Preparation for Sending To prepare for sending all parties command export_multisig_info <filename> and send the file to all other parties To complete preparation, all parties command import_multisig_info <filename1> <filename2> and import files from other parties Sending To send, any party can use the usual transfer command, but the result will be a file named multisig_loki_tx which must be sent to any 1 other signer The other party commands sign_multisig multisig_loki_tx and the file is updated with the signature. The completely signed file is pushed to the network with use of submit_multisig multisig_loki_tx . Below is a step-by-step walkthrough. Wallet Creation \u00b6 Requirements: 3 empty loki-wallet-cli wallets All parties wallets connected to a lokid Private communication channel Step 1 - Prepare Multisig \u00b6 All 3 people should open up their loki-wallet-cli and generate a new wallet. Make sure you do not have any $loki within your wallet. Person 1, 2 and 3 runs the following command within their loki-wallet-cli : prepare_multisig The output will be something like: MultisigV1cR7X7ZAfa5ncRmQv1hpt4P1DmmnhinhokhDMqsmuWXmHFrb6xUr3FtBGygCfMScxnKJvXK1vvPNahXNWfYWVquieBErr98sFtgs24c2YuYrQT78uxV8oYx1A9bKeHSUfYzCniN5kMznEfvKCw3FiomjLvw364gg98ZWp16zA7pUVozid Send this multisig info to all other participants, then use make_multisig <threshold> <info1> [<info2>...] with others' multisig info This includes the PRIVATE view key, so needs to be disclosed only to that multisig wallet's participants Copy the entire line Multisig\u2026...Vozid and be sure to capture the whole thing when copying. Person 1 to send the Multsig...arg to Person 2 and 3, Person 2 to send their output to Person 1 and 3 and Person 3 to send their output to Person 1 and 2. Step 2 - Make Multisig \u00b6 All 3 persons now have the Multisig...arg text from the other 2. With that, each of them can create their part of the multisig wallet. Before you proceed, note that the wallet will lose access to the underlying wallet when converted to multisig. This is not really a problem, since we started with an empty wallet, and if all goes OK with this step, you won't ever need it unless you want to go through the process again for whatever reason (like HDD died, but you have the seed mnemonic of the underlying wallet and want to reconstruct the multisig wallet). Person 1 commands: make_multisig <threshold> <data person 2> <data person 3> Where <threshold> is the number of signers required out of the 3 people, <data person 2> is the output provided by Person 2, and <data person 3> is the output provided by Person 3. This should look similar to: make_multisig 2 MultisigV12EHtuvxFyAYDNcDsbDqWHDfkRr4JZchSdf8eZQSFwiMKDk15CYEJeQyEwtSnqUZdRr2BsEaT9z2biUdDTEQM4T3N625owvKMDoyhbRj3bwkBtceLKimap8DBAiUmSABpdf62HnPYiRtLW4JdVFmfqjndhWjYBypx1duvpi3qwfSrBY9a MultisigV1TqQ8Gt5Sb3GYtVJa1fQrK7e7hPm59XbooNvLxPSBR4856bW9jtD1hEyWy4yULKrX7reZZ6vrKdBCdSdk4nfApCGYJAA2WP4pKNwHDyKTuLEeuoDhqno8keEVeEF9AZsWXvng1avUTRREmy11h8wu8pdjopC4AguQKiHCJCN7aT9W6b8C Notice how there are 2 strings starting with Multisig....arg . One is from person 2 and other from person 3. The number at the beginning is the minimum required number of signatures. Since it's a 2/3 scheme - it's 2. The output from the make_multisig command will be similar to: Another step is needed MultisigxV1PKCwmVrucV8bXi18VnHFqRXcnAq4osFL3ahzPHCiN48zhs28u6jmEhy7ktZbUEGfRtTuFjjKzJYb61fnFwnysBBnNXsUtCgFMXPa7FyNKVy2AnUg3ePEnKqWkgKVvA81axTS8r9EX1DmVPXgFKkFzw4Yj4ZtMcJVo77b5ayuMzjFtsaijko9X2bjd9AVfFVGBFMCSLa4xXhNVNz19CTUJx5gpoPG Send this multisig info to all other participants, then use finalize_multisig <info1> [<info2>...] with others' multisig info With 2/3 there's an additional step to be done here. The new Multisig...arg info must be passed to ALL other participants (persons 2 & 3). Persons 2 & 3 do the same as above and send the info to other 2 parties. Step 3 - Finalize Multisig \u00b6 Here we do one last command to make the wallet ready for receiving. It requires the 2nd batch of Multisig\u2026....arg strings received from other parties. Person 1 will run the command: finalize_multisig MultisigxV1Vg1tsRLurvAc5aSA9Hd9God3MQhijCFoE1rPDFzx7ufwhs28u6jmEhy7ktZbUEGfRtTuFjjKzJYb61fnFwnysBBnfYm4xJWcJ4qM4khSb2KkyAKDuT39pTvdmemhojNjeYCmgSQ1NZLyBj48R1tVpiGNxa7TDnGbSgLuKBq35AX6jfu5PECAcDDn22CFQbJZip7xnBbn89Szzh27xeozfxcLiqqm MultisigxV14xDZBGACz3iUh2aVKGE5q5VzcvJdg2qCvZECgUWCdy5QNXsUtCgFMXPa7FyNKVy2AnUg3ePEnKqWkgKVvA81axTSfYm4xJWcJ4qM4khSb2KkyAKDuT39pTvdmemhojNjeYCmCNaRSsDEcemLLL8wCvzsy5R6hhkhWLYkD9vhZwprSFFKMZ7tfRko2VfMBoKQhB7PKXbf1npk2xceVKu2y7kExywb Unfortunately the wallet will not display an output at this point. There's no indication that the process was successfully completed (for now). All 3 persons do the same, and all 3 wallets will show the same address after this step. Now each person run the command: address And each 3 parties of the multisig wallet should be shown the same address in their wallet. Receiving \u00b6 Step 1 Fund The Multisig Account \u00b6 This is simple. Just send to the shared address. You can send multiple times, just like a normal wallet. You can use payment ID\u2019s as well, or generate an integrated address to receive funds. Best part, whomever is sending the funds won't be able to tell that the address belongs to a multisig wallet since it looks like any other Loki address. Step 2 Check Multisig Account Balance \u00b6 Just open the wallet and run the refresh command . Once completed, all persons can verify that the funds arrived. Person 1, 2 & 3 can run the command: show_transfers To see incoming transfers or the following command to see the balance of the wallet: balance Preparation for Spending \u00b6 Step 1 - Export Multisig \u00b6 Without this step, it will not be possible to create a transaction that spends Loki. As a minimum, the sender needs to get a partial key image from the same person who will sign the transaction with him later. He could get from both parties immediately and then later decide with whom to sign. Person 1 commands: export_multisig_info mi1 Where mi1 can be any filename. The output will be: Multisig info exported to mi1 The file mi1 will be located in the shell working folder* Person 1 sends that file to other persons. Persons 2 & 3 do the same. Optional: Step 1.2 Sending Multisig Info File with terminal - transfer.sh \u00b6 It is optional to use the terminal to send each person the multisig info files. Uploading Multisig Info file \u00b6 Person 1 will open up a new terminal and change to the directory mi1 has been saved.* Person 1 will run the following command: curl --upload-file ./mi1 https://transfer.sh/mi1 Person 1 will receive the link to the file as an output, looking similar to: https://transfer.sh/Ehl5q/mi1 Person 1 will need to send this link to Person 2 and Person 3. Person 2 will need to do the same and send the link to Person 1 and 3. Person 3 will need to do the same and send the link to Person 1 and 2. Downloading Multisig Info file \u00b6 Person 1 should change to the directory of their loki-wallet-cli and use Person 2 and 3\u2019s download link to run the commands: curl <link> -o <filename> Replacing <link> with the link Person 2 and 3 shared with Person 1 and <filename> with the filename of the Multisig info file that Person 2 or 3 generated, for example Person 1 will run the command: curl https://transfer.sh/Iedv9/mi2 -o mi2 And the command: curl https://transfer.sh/dfvr3/mi3 -o mi3 Likewise, Person 2 and 3 should do the same, changing directories to their loki-wallet-cli and downloading with the alternative Persons download link, and filename. curl https://transfer.sh/Ehl5q/mi1 -o mi1 Step 2 - Import Multisig \u00b6 Now, they must all import each other's file so they can be ready to make a TX later. For example, Person 2 commands: import_multisig_info mi1 The wallet will look for files in the shell working folder and if the files are found the output will look like: 2 outputs found in mi1 Height 1357156, transaction <88ba687dc79a0b39e6de6d0763eda8363d33d9f58ec9a096171bd9a7f1dae873>, received 0.100000000000 Height 1357161, transaction <d6ac845b9400759525519cdc5d514eb8f5b1d265b24d1c016e75b20ed3b4b7da>, received 0.100000000000 Persons 1 & 3 do the same. Spending \u00b6 Step 1 - Transfer (Preparing Unsigned Transaction) \u00b6 Any of the 3 persons can start a transaction, it doesn't matter. To avoid weird things from happening only do it for 1 transaction at a time. If anything weird happens, do the step 1 & 2 again to fix. For example, let's say that Person 3 will make the TX. Person 3 performs the usual transfer command: transfer T6TmZX8EzZVjS9zNg7zAsrEQFDgcVC2qV2ZMyoWsbyK4SNB2SwMHZtMhPSsFyTmRBQUaGVF5k3qy5CMFM6Lvj7gi3AeszDag7 50 The output will look like: Unsigned transaction(s) successfully written to file: multisig_loki_tx Check in the folder where you started loki-wallet-cli from. There should be a file named multisig_loki_tx . Send the file multisig_loki_tx to either person 1 or 2. Person 3 will send the file multisig_loki_tx to the Person 1 or 2. Person 3 can send this file through email or alternatively use the transfer.sh commands outside of the wallet: curl --upload-file ./multisig_loki_tx https://transfer.sh/multisig_loki_tx If Person 3 chooses to use transfer.sh command to send the file to Person 1 or 2 they will receive a <link> . Person 1 or 2 must finish the signature. Person 1 or 2 copies/downloads the file to the same folder from where he started (or will start) loki-wallet-cli . Person 1 or 2 can run the command to download the file to the loki-wallet-cli directory. curl https://transfer.sh/CJqnM/multisig_loki_tx -o multisig_loki_tx Replacing https://transfer.sh/CJqnM/multisig_loki_tx with the link provided by Person 3. Step 2 - Sign Multisig \u00b6 Let's say Person 2 was picked as the partner. He must finish the signature. Person 2 copies the file to the same folder from where he started (or will start) loki-wallet-cli . Then, Person 2 commands: sign_multisig multisig_loki_tx and they will be prompted to check it first: Loaded 1 transactions, for 108.082287779, fee 0.061108880, sending 50.000000000 to T6TmZX8EzZVjS9zNg7zAsrEQFDgcVC2qV2ZMyoWsbyK4SNB2SwMHZtMhPSsFyTmRBQUaGVF5k3qy5CMFM6Lvj7gi3AeszDag7, 58.021178899 change to T6ScXhWpAG2aUHmFemwvn4HddHA5GQ4u6MvYsW2hVteJSwLJXCEhk2aVp4XzyqGmvyUqc3w8fwWwg6szGEytUSx51C6WQ3er8, with min ring size 10, no payment ID.

Is this okay? (Y/Yes/N/No): If ok, answer Y , and the transaction will be sent. The output will look like: Transaction successfully submitted, transaction <3b03b16c79eaa5564171ae88242c4cdb1f9e0b41fc3de949c6524c5026a3f3bb> You can check its status by using the show_transfers command. The person 2 could also send the signed TX to person 3, who could then submit it to the network himself. If you want to make another one, you have to go back to preparation for spending step (sync the key images again). The wallet will look for the files and export them to the folder from where it was started, ie where your command prompt / shell was when you called loki-wallet-cli . It may or may not be the same folder as your actual wallet files or loki-wallet-cli , depending on how you go about it. For example, your wallet could be on some USB drive like f:\\temp\\ , and your wallet software on c:\\loki\\ and your shell working folder could be c:\\ . If you remain in c:\\ with the shell, you could start the wallet by its full path and specify the wallet file location: c:\\loki\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file f:\\temp\\mywallet . In this case, all the import/export stuff would be read/written to c:\\ because that's still your shell's working folder. It would be probably feel more natural to cd into the wallet folder. Do f: to change drive and then cd f:\\temp\\ . Then, simply start the wallet from that location by its full path again: c:\\loki\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file mywallet . Notice how you don't have to write the full wallet path now as you're already there with your shell. In this case, all the files mentioned above would be written or read from the same folder as the wallet files.

The wallet will look for the files and export them to the folder from where it was started, ie where your command prompt / shell was when you called loki-wallet-cli . It may or may not be the same folder as your actual wallet files or loki-wallet-cli , depending on how you go about it. For example, your wallet could be on some USB drive like f:\\temp\\ , and your wallet software on c:\\loki\\ and your shell working folder could be c:\\ . If you remain in c:\\ with the shell, you could start the wallet by its full path and specify the wallet file location: c:\\loki\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file f:\\temp\\mywallet . In this case, all the import/export stuff would be read/written to c:\\ because that's still your shell's working folder. It would be probably feel more natural to cd into the wallet folder. Do f: to change drive and then cd f:\\temp\\ . Then, simply start the wallet from that location by its full path again: c:\\loki\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file mywallet . Notice how you don't have to write the full wallet path now as you're already there with your shell. In this case, all the files mentioned above would be written or read from the same folder as the wallet files.

It is best to use a brand-new wallet for the purpose, although not required. It is strongly advised to make a copy of the wallet files first, just in case something goes wrong. Overview \u00b6 In short, the process is: Wallet Creation All parties command prepare_multisig and send data to ALL other parties All parties command make_multisig <threshold> <data1> <data2> .... <dataN> and send 2nd batch of data to ALL other parties All parties command finalize_multisig <data1> <data2> ...... <DataM> with the data from ALL other parties. Receiving All parties can type address to see the created multisig wallet address. The address will, of course, be the same for all parties since they're all watching the same wallet. Preparation for Sending To prepare for sending all parties command export_multisig_info <filename> and send the file to all other parties To complete preparation, all parties command import_multisig_info <filename1> <filename2> ..... <filenameM> and import files from other parties Sending To send, any party can use the usual transfer command, but the result will be a file named multisig_loki_tx which must be sent to any 1 other signer The other party commands sign_multisig multisig_loki_tx and the file is updated with the signature. The completely signed file is pushed to the network with use of submit_multisig multisig_loki_tx . Below is a step-by-step walkthrough. Wallet Creation \u00b6 Requirements: N empty loki-wallet-cli wallets. All parties wallets connected to a lokid . Private communication channel. Step 1 - Prepare Multisig \u00b6 All N people should open up their loki-wallet-cli and generate a new wallet. Make sure you do not have any $loki within your wallet. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd , and so on, up to the N th person commands in their loki-wallet-cli : prepare_multisig The output will be something like: MultisigV1cR7X7ZAfa5ncRmQv1hpt4P1DmmnhinhokhDMqsmuWXmHFrb6xUr3FtBGygCfMScxnKJvXK1vvPNahXNWfYWVquieBErr98sFtgs24c2YuYrQT78uxV8oYx1A9bKeHSUfYzCniN5kMznEfvKCw3FiomjLvw364gg98ZWp16zA7pUVozid Send this multisig info to all other participants, then use make_multisig <threshold> <info1> [<info2>...] with others' multisig info This includes the PRIVATE view key, so needs to be disclosed only to that multisig wallet's participants Copy the entire line Multisig\u2026...Vozid and be sure to capture the whole thing when copying. Each person must send their Multisig\u2026...arg to each other person, it is suggested to send this information through a private comunication channel. Step 2 - Make Multisig \u00b6 All N people now have the Multisig...arg text from the other N-1 people. With that, each of them can create their part of the multisig wallet. Before you proceed, note that the wallet will lose access to the underlying wallet when converted to multisig. This is not really a problem, since we started with an empty wallet, and if all goes OK with this step, you won't ever need it unless you want to go through the process again for whatever reason (like HDD died, but you have the seed mnemonic of the underlying wallet and want to reconstruct the multisig wallet). Person 1 commands: make_multisig <threshold> <data person 2> <data person 3> ..... <data person N> Where <threshold> is the number of signers required out of the N people, <data person 2> is the output provided by Person 2, and <data person 3> is the output provided by Person 3, and <data person N> is the output provided by the N th person. This is the process for M of N multisig wallets, For the below example we will show a 2 of 3 multisig wallet. This should look similar to: make_multisig 2 MultisigV12EHtuvxFyAYDNcDsbDqWHDfkRr4JZchSdf8eZQSFwiMKDk15CYEJeQyEwtSnqUZdRr2BsEaT9z2biUdDTEQM4T3N625owvKMDoyhbRj3bwkBtceLKimap8DBAiUmSABpdf62HnPYiRtLW4JdVFmfqjndhWjYBypx1duvpi3qwfSrBY9a MultisigV1TqQ8Gt5Sb3GYtVJa1fQrK7e7hPm59XbooNvLxPSBR4856bW9jtD1hEyWy4yULKrX7reZZ6vrKdBCdSdk4nfApCGYJAA2WP4pKNwHDyKTuLEeuoDhqno8keEVeEF9AZsWXvng1avUTRREmy11h8wu8pdjopC4AguQKiHCJCN7aT9W6b8C Notice how there are 2 strings starting with Multisig....arg . One is from person 2 and other from person 3, if their is 5 different people their would be 4 different strings of Multisig....arg . The number at the beginning is the minimum required number of signatures. Since it's a 2/3 scheme - it's 2. To reiterate, for a 5/8 scheme which means there are 8 people who can sign and 5 people must sign to authorise a transaction out of the Multi signature wallet. In this circumstance, the command each person would run has a <threshold> that equals 5 and 7 strings of multisig...arg . The output from the make_multisig command will be similar to: Another step is needed MultisigxV1PKCwmVrucV8bXi18VnHFqRXcnAq4osFL3ahzPHCiN48zhs28u6jmEhy7ktZbUEGfRtTuFjjKzJYb61fnFwnysBBnNXsUtCgFMXPa7FyNKVy2AnUg3ePEnKqWkgKVvA81axTS8r9EX1DmVPXgFKkFzw4Yj4ZtMcJVo77b5ayuMzjFtsaijko9X2bjd9AVfFVGBFMCSLa4xXhNVNz19CTUJx5gpoPG Send this multisig info to all other participants, then use finalize_multisig <info1> [<info2>...] with others' multisig info With any M of N schemes there's an additional step to be done here. The new Multisig...arg info that was just outputted must be passed to ALL other participants (For person 1 they must send it to persons 2 & 3 ... all the way up to person N). Persons N sends the new output to all other persons. Step 3 - Finalize Multisig \u00b6 Here we do one last command to make the wallet ready for receiving. It requires the 2nd batch of Multisig\u2026....arg strings received from other parties. Person N will run the command: finalize_multisig MultisigxV1Vg1tsRLurvAc5aSA9Hd9God3MQhijCFoE1rPDFzx7ufwhs28u6jmEhy7ktZbUEGfRtTuFjjKzJYb61fnFwnysBBnfYm4xJWcJ4qM4khSb2KkyAKDuT39pTvdmemhojNjeYCmgSQ1NZLyBj48R1tVpiGNxa7TDnGbSgLuKBq35AX6jfu5PECAcDDn22CFQbJZip7xnBbn89Szzh27xeozfxcLiqqm MultisigxV14xDZBGACz3iUh2aVKGE5q5VzcvJdg2qCvZECgUWCdy5QNXsUtCgFMXPa7FyNKVy2AnUg3ePEnKqWkgKVvA81axTSfYm4xJWcJ4qM4khSb2KkyAKDuT39pTvdmemhojNjeYCmCNaRSsDEcemLLL8wCvzsy5R6hhkhWLYkD9vhZwprSFFKMZ7tfRko2VfMBoKQhB7PKXbf1npk2xceVKu2y7kExywb Unfortunately the wallet will not display an output at this point. There's no indication that the process was successfully completed (for now). All N persons do the same, and all N wallets will show the same address after this step. Now each person run the command: address And each N people of the multisig wallet should be shown the same address in their wallet. Receiving \u00b6 Step 1 Fund The Multisig Account \u00b6 This is simple, just send to the shared address. You can send multiple times, just like a normal wallet. You can use payment ID\u2019s as well, or generate an integrated address to receive funds. Best part, whomever is sending the funds won't be able to tell that the address belongs to a multisig wallet since it looks like any other Loki address. Step 2 Check Multisig Account Balance \u00b6 Just open the wallet and run the refresh command. Once completed, all persons can verify that the funds arrived. Person 1, 2 , 3 up to N can run the command: show_transfers To see incoming transfers or the following command to see the balance of the wallet: balance Preparation for Spending \u00b6 Step 1 - Export Multisig \u00b6 Without this step, it will not be possible to create a transaction that spends Loki. As a minimum, the sender needs to get a partial key image from all the people who will sign the transaction with them later. They could get it from the parties immediately and then later decide with whom to sign. Person N commands: export_multisig_info miN Where miN can be any filename. The output will be: Multisig info exported to miN The file miN will be located in the shell working folder* Person N sends that file to other people. Persons 2 & 3 up to N do the same. Optional: Step 1.2 Sending Multisig Info File with terminal - transfer.sh \u00b6 It is optional to use the terminal to send each person the multisig info files. Uploading Multisig Info file \u00b6 Person 1 will open up a new terminal and change to the directory mi1 has been saved.* Person 1 will run the following command: curl --upload-file ./mi1 https://transfer.sh/mi1 Person 1 will receive the link to the file as an output, looking similar to: https://transfer.sh/Ehl5q/mi1 Person 1 will need to send this link to Person 2, Person 3, .... Person N. Person 2 will need to do the same and send the link to Person 1, 3 ..... N. Person 3 will need to do the same and send the link to Person 1, 2 ..... N. Person N will need to do the same and send the link to Person 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...... N-1. Downloading Multisig Info file \u00b6 Person 1 should change to the directory of their loki-wallet-cli and use Person 2, 3, 4 ... N\u2019s download link to run the commands: curl <link> -o <filename> Replacing <link> with the link Person 2, 3 ... N shared with Person 1 and <filename> with the filename of the Multisig info file that Person 2, 3 or ... N generated, for example Person 1 will run the command: curl https://transfer.sh/Iedv9/mi2 -o mi2 And the command: curl https://transfer.sh/dfvr3/mi3 -o mi3 and all the way up to: curl https://transfer.sh/dfvr3/mi3 -o miN Likewise, Person 2, 3 .... and N should do the same, changing directories to their loki-wallet-cli and downloading with the alternative Persons download link, and filename. curl https://transfer.sh/Ehl5q/mi1 -o mi1 Step 2 - Import Multisig \u00b6 Now, they must all import each other's file so they can be ready to make a TX later. For example, Person 2 commands: import_multisig_info mi1 import_multisig_info mi3 import_multisig_info miN The wallet will look for files in the shell working folder* and if the files are found the output will look like: 2 outputs found in mi1 Height 1357156, transaction <88ba687dc79a0b39e6de6d0763eda8363d33d9f58ec9a096171bd9a7f1dae873>, received 0.100000000000 Height 1357161, transaction <d6ac845b9400759525519cdc5d514eb8f5b1d265b24d1c016e75b20ed3b4b7da>, received 0.100000000000 Persons 1 , 3 .... and N do the same. Spending \u00b6 Step 1 - Transfer (Preparing Unsigned Transaction) \u00b6 Any of the multisig wallets can start a transaction, it doesn't matter. To avoid weird things from happening only do it for 1 transaction at a time. If anything weird happens, do the step 1 & 2 again to fix. For example, let's say that Person 3 will make the TX. Person 3 performs the usual transfer command: transfer T6TmZX8EzZVjS9zNg7zAsrEQFDgcVC2qV2ZMyoWsbyK4SNB2SwMHZtMhPSsFyTmRBQUaGVF5k3qy5CMFM6Lvj7gi3AeszDag7 50 The output will look like: Unsigned transaction(s) successfully written to file: multisig_loki_tx Check in the folder where you started loki-wallet-cli from. There should be a file named multisig_loki_tx . Send the file multisig_loki_tx to one of the people who will sign the TX. Person 3 will send the file multisig_loki_tx to the Person 1, 2 or N. Person 3 can send this file through email or alternatively use the transfer.sh commands outside of the wallet: curl --upload-file ./multisig_loki_tx https://transfer.sh/multisig_loki_tx If Person 3 chooses to use transfer.sh command to send the file to Person 1 or 2 they will receive a <link> . Person 1 or 2 must finish the signature. Person 1 or 2 copies/downloads the file to the same folder from where he started (or will start) loki-wallet-cli . Person 1 or 2 can run the command to download the file to the loki-wallet-cli directory. curl https://transfer.sh/CJqnM/multisig_loki_tx -o multisig_loki_tx Replacing https://transfer.sh/CJqnM/multisig_loki_tx with the link provided by Person 3. Step 2 - Sign Multisig \u00b6 Let's say Person 2 was picked as the partner. They must finish the signature. Person 2 copies the file to the same folder from where he started (or will start) loki-wallet-cli . Then, Person 2 commands: sign_multisig multisig_loki_tx and they will be prompted to check it first: Loaded 1 transactions, for 108.082287779, fee 0.061108880, sending 50.000000000 to T6TmZX8EzZVjS9zNg7zAsrEQFDgcVC2qV2ZMyoWsbyK4SNB2SwMHZtMhPSsFyTmRBQUaGVF5k3qy5CMFM6Lvj7gi3AeszDag7, 58.021178899 change to T6ScXhWpAG2aUHmFemwvn4HddHA5GQ4u6MvYsW2hVteJSwLJXCEhk2aVp4XzyqGmvyUqc3w8fwWwg6szGEytUSx51C6WQ3er8, with min ring size 10, no payment ID.

Step 3 - Submit Multisig \u00b6 Finally, person with the final signed file submits the transaction to the network by commanding: submit_multisig multisig_loki_tx There will be a confirmation prompt: Loaded 1 transactions, for 108.082287779, fee 0.061108880, sending 50.000000000 to T6TmZX8EzZVjS9zNg7zAsrEQFDgcVC2qV2ZMyoWsbyK4SNB2SwMHZtMhPSsFyTmRBQUaGVF5k3qy5CMFM6Lvj7gi3AeszDag7, 58.021178899 change to T6ScXhWpAG2aUHmFemwvn4HddHA5GQ4u6MvYsW2hVteJSwLJXCEhk2aVp4XzyqGmvyUqc3w8fwWwg6szGEytUSx51C6WQ3er8, with min ring size 10, no payment ID.

The person 2 could also send the signed TX to person 3, who could then submit it to the network himself. If you want to make another one, you have to go back to preparation for spending step (sync the key images again). The wallet will look for the files and export them to the folder from where it was started, ie where your command prompt / shell was when you called loki-wallet-cli . It may or may not be the same folder as your actual wallet files or loki-wallet-cli , depending on how you go about it.

The wallet will look for the files and export them to the folder from where it was started, ie where your command prompt / shell was when you called loki-wallet-cli . It may or may not be the same folder as your actual wallet files or loki-wallet-cli , depending on how you go about it. For example, your wallet could be on some USB drive like f:\\temp\\ , and your wallet software on c:\\loki\\ and your shell working folder could be c:\\ . If you remain in c:\\ with the shell, you could start the wallet by its full path and specify the wallet file location: c:\\loki\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file f:\\temp\\mywallet . In this case, all the import/export stuff would be read/written to c:\\ because that's still your shell's working folder. It would be probably feel more natural to cd into the wallet folder. Do f: to change drive and then cd f:\\temp\\ . Then, simply start the wallet from that location by its full path again: c:\\loki\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file mywallet . Notice how you don't have to write the full wallet path now as you're already there with your shell. In this case, all the files mentioned above would be written or read from the same folder as the wallet files.

If at any time you wish to create an additional account use the command: account new <label text with white spaces allowed> This command will create a subaddress which is labelled with a tag and index number. This subaddress will share the same seed as your Primary address. To ensure this new account is displayed you must type exit to save your session. You will note that there is now an asterisk to the left of index 1. The asterisks show us the account in which the commands we run will apply to. Note: Restoring your wallet from your seed will not restore your accounts as the index of your subaddress data is stored on your computer within your wallet file.

For example: [wallet T6TmZX]: balance Currently selected account: [0] Primary account Tag: (No tag assigned) Balance: 172286.035054991, unlocked balance: 172086.338373771 While running the command balance detail will generate a more detailed output, showing the account number, first few characters of the address, balance, unlocked balance, Outputs and the Label of the account. For example: [wallet T6TmZX]: balance detail Currently selected account: [0] Primary account Tag: (No tag assigned) Balance: 172286.035054991, unlocked balance: 172086.338373771 Balance per address: Address Balance Unlocked balance Outputs Label 0 T6TmZX 172286.035054991 172086.338373771 3347 Primary account There are other commands that will also output the balance which have been covered by this guide, such as the account command. 3 Getting the Block Height \u00b6 To show the blockchain height run the command: bc_height 4 Blackballing Transactions \u00b6 Blackballing transactions allows you to ignore others' outputs (containers of money) that are known to be spent in a certain transaction. For example let\u2019s imagine that txid: 4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542 is known to be fake and if this txid is seen within a RingCT transaction the network can assume it is fake, therefore an actor has a better chance of deducing the real transaction within the RingCT. By blackballing the above txid we remove the chance of it being used within our RingCT. To do this we will use the following command: blackball <output public key> | <filename> [add] For example: [wallet LAXk6e]: blackball 4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542 To check if the txid was added to our list of txids not to use we can use the following command: blackballed <output public key> If the txid is on our list the following will output: [wallet LAXk6e]: blackballed 4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542 [wallet LAXk6e]: Blackballed: <4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542> Alternatively if the txid is not on our list the following will output: [wallet LAXk6e]: blackballed 4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542 [wallet LAXk6e]: not blackballed: <4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542> To unblackball a txid use the following command: unblackball <output public key> For example: [wallet LAXk6e]: unblackball 4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542 5 Reserve Proof \u00b6 Reserve Proofs are used to generate a signature proving that you own an amount of Loki, with the option to sign the reserve proof with a key. For example let\u2019s imagine you see a car for sale but they will accept Loki as payment, however they have advised in their online listing that they are only interested in serious buyers and require you to prove you have the Loki within your initial contact. Luckily we can use the Reserve Proof commands for this proof. 5.1 Generate Reserve Proof \u00b6 To begin we will need to run the get_reserve_proof command to generate our proof. get_reserve_proof (all|<amount>) [<message>] If the individual you are sending this proof to requires you to prove you have 1000 Loki you will need to replace the section (all|<amount>) with a 1000, otherwise replace it with the amount you need to prove you have reserved. If you want to put an extra layer of encryption over the file replace [<message>] with a password. Your command will similar to the below command: get_reserve_proof 1000 Car The Cli will request your wallet password and once your password is entered it will tell you it generated a signature file. [wallet T6TmZX]: get_reserve_proof 1000 Car Wallet password: signature file saved to: loki_reserve_proof This signature file loki_reserve_proof will be saved in your Loki folder, where your daemon and wallet keys are. Keep in mind every time you run the get_reserve_proof command it will overwrite your loki_reserve_proof file. You will want to send this file to the person who requires the proof. You can upload the loki_reserve_proof file through https://transfer.sh/ by running the command within the folder of your signature file: curl --upload-file ./loki_reserve_proof https://transfer.sh/loki_reserve_proof` The terminal will then print out a link to your signature file which you can then provide to the individual performing the check. https://transfer.sh/QhoC7/loki_reserve_proof Make sure you provide the following to the individual who will be checking your reserve proof: The loki_reserve_proof file through the transfer.sh link. The loki address you are proving has Loki in it. The <message> if you encrypted the file. 5.2 Checking Reserve Proof \u00b6 To check a reserve proof we need to first have the loki_reserve_proof file in our Loki folder. If you do not have the loki_reserve_proof file in your loki folder request the individual sending the file to you to use https://transfer.sh/ , once they send you the link to their loki_reserve_proof you can use the following command to download it. curl <link> -o loki_reserve_proof Replacing <link> with the link to download the loki_reserve_proof . Now that the loki_reserve_proof is in our folder we can run the following command: check_reserve_proof <address> <signature_file> [<message>] Where <address> is the address of the wallet where the command get_reserve_proof was ran. <signiture_file> is the file that was received from the individual sending you the reserve proof, normally generated as loki_reserve_proof and <message> is the key set by the individual who sent you the reserve proof. Therefor for the previous example where we created a reserve proof for 1000 loki and signed with \u201ccar\u201d, we would run the command: check_reserve_proof T6TmZX8EzZVjS9zNg7zAsrEQFDgcVC2qV2ZMyoWsbyK4SNB2SwMHZtMhPSsFyTmRBQUaGVF5k3qy5CMFM6Lvj7gi3AeszDag7 loki_reserve_proof Car If all goes well, the terminal will output the following: Good signature -- total: 1014.862440831, spent: 0.000000000, unspent: 1014.862440831 You may note that it shows a reserve proof which is greater than 1000, this is because the command is adding up all the transactions into the address specified until it is greater than the reserve proof set. 6 Spend Proof \u00b6 Spend Proofs are used to generate a signature proving that you generated a TXID, with the option to sign the spend proof with a key. For example let\u2019s imagine you have bought a car from a dealership with loki and have sent 1000 loki to the seller. Unfortunately the dealer does not know which transaction is yours as he has received 5 transactions of 1000 loki in the same block for 5 different cars. He knows the txid\u2019s but wants you to prove that you have generate one of the txid\u2019s in his list. Luckily we can prove we generated the txid by using the get_spend_proof command. 6.1 Generate Spend Proof \u00b6 To begin we will first need to find the txid associated with our transaction. To do this run the following command in our wallet: show_transfers The terminal will output a list of transactions in and out of your address. You should have a transaction in your list with the amount you spent to the dealership. Copy the txid(by highlighting) associated with this transaction and save it in a notepad for later. We can now run the get_spend_proof command to generate our proof. get_spend_proof <txid> [<message>] Replacing <txid> with the txid of our transfer out and replacing <message> if we want to add a password to the proof. If all went well the terminal will output the following text: signature file saved to: loki_spend_proof This signature file loki_spend_proof will be saved in your Loki folder, where your daemon and wallet keys are. Keep in mind every time you run the get_spend_proof command it will overwrite your loki_spend_proof file . You will want to send this file to the person who requires the proof. You can upload the loki_spend_proof file through https://transfer.sh/ by running the command within the folder of your signature file: curl --upload-file ./loki_spend_proof https://transfer.sh/loki_spend_proof The terminal will then print out a link to your signature file which you can then provide to the individual performing the check. For example: https://transfer.sh/QhoC7/loki_spend_proof Make sure you provide the following to the individual who will be checking your reserve proof: The loki_spend_proof file through the transfer.sh link. The loki transaction txid associated with the transaction you are proving you generated. The <message> if you encrypted the file. 6.2 Checking Spend Proof \u00b6 To check a spend proof we need to first have the loki_spend_proof file in our Loki folder and the txid associated with the transaction being proved. If you do not have the loki_spend_proof file in your loki folder request the individual sending the file to you to use https://transfer.sh/ , once they send you the link to their loki_spend_proof you can use the following command to download it. curl <link> -o loki_spend_proof Replacing <link> with the link to download the loki_spend_proof . Now that the loki_spend_proof is in our folder we can run the following command: check_spend_proof <txid> <signature_file> [<message>] Where <txid> is the txid associated with the transaction that is being proved. <signiture_file> is the file that was received from the individual sending you the spend proof, normally generated as loki_spend_proof and <message> is the key set by the individual who sent you the spend proof. An example would look like the following command check_spend_proof 20eb3b5545d6587e5a379feb2fc69b43d4f8b6b825bb7eff78e263d4e7e8eaa9 loki_spend_proof car If all goes well, the terminal will output the following: Good signature If you receive a Good signature message that should be a good proof that the txid you are checking was generated from the sender. Keep in mind however that this can potentially not always be the case, considering someone could get access to someone else's computer thus having access to this file. 7 TX Proof \u00b6 TX Proofs are used to generate a signature file proving that you generated a TXID, with the option to sign the spend proof with a key. TX proofs work similar to Reserve Proof\u2019s and Spend Proofs however they show more detailed information. For example let\u2019s imagine you have bought a car from a dealership with loki and have sent 1000 loki to the seller. Unfortunately the dealer does not know which transaction is yours as he has received 5 transactions of 1000 loki in the same block for 5 different cars. He knows the txid\u2019s but wants you to prove that you have generate one of the txid\u2019s in his list. Luckily we can prove we generated the txid by using the get_tx_proof command. 7.1 Generate Spend Proof \u00b6 To begin we will first need to find the txid associated with our transaction. To do this run the following command in our wallet: show_transfers The terminal will output a list of transactions in and out of your address. You should have a transaction in your list with the amount you spent to the dealership. Copy the txid(by highlighting) associated with this transaction and save it in a notepad for later. We can now run the get_tx_proof command to generate our proof. get_tx_proof <txid> <address> [<message>] Replacing <txid> with the txid of our transfer out, <address> with the receiver's address, and replacing <message> if we want to add a password to the proof. If all went well the terminal will output the following text: signature file saved to: loki_tx_proof This signature file loki_tx_proof will be saved in your Loki folder, where your daemon and wallet keys are. Keep in mind every time you run the get_tx_proof command it will overwrite your loki_tx_proof file. You will want to send this file to the person who requires the proof. You can upload the loki_tx_proof file through https://transfer.sh/ by running the command within the folder of your signature file: curl --upload-file ./loki_tx_proof https://transfer.sh/loki_tx_proof The terminal will then print out a link to your signature file which you can then provide to the individual performing the check. For example: https://transfer.sh/QhoC7/loki_tx_proof Make sure you provide the following to the individual who will be checking your reserve proof: The loki_tx_proof file through the transfer.sh link. The loki transaction txid associated with the transaction you are proving you generated. The receivers loki address. The <message> if you encrypted the file. 7.2 Checking tx Proof \u00b6 To check a tx proof we need to first have the loki_tx_proof file in our Loki folder, the receiver's address and the txid associated with the transaction being proved. If you do not have the loki_tx_proof file in your loki folder request the individual sending the file to you to use https://transfer.sh/ , once they send you the link to their loki_tx_proof you can use the following command to download it. curl <link> -o loki_tx_proof Replacing <link> with the link to download the loki_tx_proof . Now that the loki_tx_proof is in our folder we can run the following command: check_tx_proof <txid> <address> <signature_file> [<message>] Where <txid> is the txid associated with the transaction that is being proved, <address> is the receiver\u2019s address and <signiture_file> is the file that was received from the individual sending you the tx proof, normally generated as loki_tx_proof and <message> is the key set by the individual who sent you the tx proof. An example would look like the following command: check_tx_proof 3f8c62b4d83100ff4f89b44a96350e65aeaa83a9b4273c31f94b9aa12e713044 TRrEpWMLd3rRuirYqsjg1iaNsukAAojWjFDhJ2kK2o4uM6tkcjMerA4SZNat6QHEYe1SoGCFQddVPgRqmkA8kARX1ffU1Wcjc loki_tx_proof If all goes well, the terminal will output the following: Good signature TRrEpWMLd3rRuirYqsjg1iaNsukAAojWjFDhJ2kK2o4uM6tkcjMerA4SZNat6QHEYe1SoGCFQddVPgRqmkA8kARX1ffU1Wcjc received 40000.000000 in txid <3f8c62b4d83100ff4f89b44a96350e65aeaa83a9b4273c31f94b9aa12e713044> This transaction has 1 confirmations If you receive a Good signature message that should be a good proof that the txid you are checking was generated from the sender. Keep in mind however that this can potentially not always be the case, considering someone could get access to someone else's computer thus having access to this file. 8 TX key \u00b6 A TX key is a private key associated with a TXid. Only the wallet that has sent the transaction can generate a TX key from the TXID that both parties can see. A TX key can be used to validate a transaction on a case by case basis. In essence, you can provide the tx key, txid and the receiver address to someone to prove you had generate that transaction. 8.1 View TX key \u00b6 To view the TX key of a specific transaction you have generate you will need to run the command: get_tx_key <txid> Where <txid> is the transaction id associated with the transfer out you are proving is yours. The terminal will prompt the user for the wallets password and then print out the tx key, which will look similar to: [wallet T6TmZX]: get_tx_key d5fb415aad43f4e45bc72566d5ad4c8f12629db1f924d953efc2521c137a987f Wallet password: Tx key: 5dfc4d677e2707317f306219b6aa445feaab4c652927237c012f7e72cb41bf0e Provide the <tx key> with the <txid> and <receiving address> to the individual who will run the validation, thus this will prove you generated the transaction. 8.2 Validate transaction with TX key \u00b6 Once we have a <tx key> , <txid> and <receiving address> from a specific transaction we can use the following command to prove they are all associated: check_tx_key <txid> <txkey> <address> For the previous example we would run the following command from any loki wallet: check_tx_key d5fb415aad43f4e45bc72566d5ad4c8f12629db1f924d953efc2521c137a987f 5dfc4d677e2707317f306219b6aa445feaab4c652927237c012f7e72cb41bf0e T6TZ2VaG1p9PQkDgdVCYwnjoxYSU7ErXX56etGsqHLugAGqynFwBvP4dnN7wvYCcJfMa9LPgtYu8UEUqyc4xsxmx2ZTyMp4U3 The terminal will show text of how much Loki the address received. It will also show how many confirmations the transaction has received from the blockchain. For example: [wallet T6TZ2V]: check_tx_key d5fb415aad43f4e45bc72566d5ad4c8f12629db1f924d953efc2521c137a987f 5dfc4d677e2707317f306219b6aa445feaab4c652927237c012f7e72cb41bf0e T6TZ2VaG1p9PQkDgdVCYwnjoxYSU7ErXX56etGsqHLugAGqynFwBvP4dnN7wvYCcJfMa9LPgtYu8UEUqyc4xsxmx2ZTyMp4U3 T6TZ2VaG1p9PQkDgdVCYwnjoxYSU7ErXX56etGsqHLugAGqynFwBvP4dnN7wvYCcJfMa9LPgtYu8UEUqyc4xsxmx2ZTyMp4U3 received 10000.000000000 in txid <d5fb415aad43f4e45bc72566d5ad4c8f12629db1f924d953efc2521c137a987f> This transaction has 10 confirmations 9 Tx Notes \u00b6 The loki-wallet-cli allows you to add notes to specific txid\u2019s, however this note does not get stored on the blockchain, rather it is stored on client side, on the device that generates the tx_note . 9.1 Set tx note \u00b6 To set a tx note we will need a the <txid> and the <message> you want to add to the txid. For instance, if you want to add a note to a txid that is connected to your wallet run the following command to show your transactions in/out with their <txid> \u2019s: show_transfers To set the note to the <txid> run the following command: set_tx_note <txid> [free text note] Where <txid> is the transaction id associated to the transaction you are adding the [free text note] too. Your command will look similar to the following example: [wallet T6TmZX]: set_tx_note d5fb415aad43f4e45bc72566d5ad4c8f12629db1f924d953efc2521c137a987f This is a tx note example. 9.2 View tx note \u00b6 To view a note connected to a txid run the following command: get_tx_note <txid> Where <txid> is the transaction id that has the note connected to it. For example, if we run the command on the previous <txid> mentioned, the terminal will display the following text: [wallet T6TmZX]: get_tx_note d5fb415aad43f4e45bc72566d5ad4c8f12629db1f924d953efc2521c137a987f note found: This is a tx note example. You can also view a tx note by running the show_transfers command, each transaction that has a note connected to it will display the text to the right of each transfer. 10 Changing wallet password \u00b6 Changing the wallet password is only client side(locally), and if the password is forgotten the wallet can always be restored with the mnemonic seed. If you know the password to the wallet and want to change it you can run the following command: password Once the command has been run the terminal will prompt you for the current password and the new password twice. If entered correctly the terminal will go back to receiving inputs, otherwise the terminal will output an error such as Passwords do not match! Please try again or Error: invalid password . 11 Encrypting seed phrase \u00b6 Your seed passphrase is a 25 word phrase which is used to recover access to your wallet on a client or gui and is. The command encrypted_seed allows your to add an additional password, or encryption layer, to your 25 word mnemonic seed. Encrypting your seed will stop others from recovering access to your wallet if they somehow gain access to your 25 word mnemonic seed as they will not have the passphrase that decrypts them. This means, your passphrase should not be written or saved in the same location as your encrypted 25 word mnemonic seed phrase. To encrypt your seed run the following command: encrypted_seed Initially the cli wallet will prompt you to enter your wallet password. Next it will request for your seed encryption passphrase, enter in your desired password/passphrase once, click enter, then type the passphrase in again. The wallet will output your mnemonic seed which is a 25 word passphrase. It is generally best practice to write these 25 words down and store them somewhere safe and securely, write your passphrase down(which is the phrase you used to encrypt the 25 words) and store this somewhere else. Storing the 25 words with the passphrase in a file on your computer that is not encrypted is giving others easier access to your mnemonic seed.","title":"CLI Wallet Commands"},{"location":"Wallets/CliWallet/WalletCommands/#loki-cli-guide","text":"The Loki CLI wallet is a wallet first developed by Monero.

The CLI wallet only uses text to do operations, where the oki-wallet-gui wallet offers a graphical user interface with buttons to do most of the operations the loki-wallet-cli does. If you are new to console or terminal commands and/or would prefer a wallet with buttons and Loki branding we would suggest you download the latest loki-wallet-gui release from here and follow the guide found here to get started. Bear in mind that the CLI wallet, while harder to use, is generally faster and more reliable. If you are still interested in the 'Loki-wallet-cli' you can find it here . Download the latest release for your specified Operating System, for this user guide we are going to assume you are running the latest MAC OS and have XCode installed. Step 1: Opening loki-wallet-cli and lokid. \u00b6 To use the loki-wallet-cli we must first have the daemon, lokid , up and running. The lokid is your node which the loki-wallet-cli broadcasts through. Without the node running the loki-wallet-cli will not be able to operate. Open up the lokid file in the folder you extracted the release from. In most cases you will have the following security dialog box pop up. If the dialog box opens up you will need to allow the lokid to open by moving your cursor to the top-left of your screen, clicking the apple logo, and then clicking on system preferences. Once in system preferences click on the Security & Privacy button, check in this new screen that the lokid file was blocked, if it was you should be confident to click \u201cOpen Anyway\u201d. Keep clicking open and allow to give the software permission to run. Once the software has permission a terminal window should pop up and say the following text: ********************************************************************** The daemon will start synchronizing with the network. This may take a long time to complete. You can set the level of process detailization through \"set_log <level|categories>\" command, where <level> is between 0 (no details) and 4 (very verbose), or custom category based levels (eg, *:WARNING). Use the \"help\" command to see the list of available commands. Use \"help <command>\" to see a command's documentation. ********************************************************************** Let the daemon run until the node is completely synced, you will know the node is synced once the terminal outputs the following text: ********************************************************************** You are now synchronized with the network. You may now start loki-wallet-cli. Use the \"help\" command to see the list of available commands. ********************************************************************** Now the daemon is synced we can run the loki-wallet-cli file. Step 2: Setting up your loki-wallet-cli account. \u00b6 If this is your first time opening the loki-wallet-cli it will request for you to specify a wallet name. For the purposes of this user guide we will use the example name MyWallet Specify wallet file name (e.g., MyWallet). If the wallet doesn't exist, it will be created. Wallet file name (or Ctrl-C to quit): MyWallet Because this is the first time we have used the name MyWallet the following text will appear in our terminal. Type in Y or Yes to confirm your wallet name. No wallet found with that name. Confirm creation of new wallet named: MyWallet (Y/Yes/N/No): Yes The loki-wallet-cli has now generated us a wallet called MyWallet and is now prompting us for a password for our generated wallet. Please note: When typing the password, the characters will not appear. It will seem as if you are typing and no text is appearing however the terminal is logging every character your clicking including if it is capitalised or lowercase. Write down your wallet name and password on a piece of paper as this information will be required every time we want to enter our wallet. Use a password with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols and make the password at least 9 characters long. Generating new wallet... Enter a new password for the wallet: Confirm password: Now once we have chosen our password for the wallet we must choose our language. For the purposes of this user guide I suggest you use English by typing 1 and clicking enter. List of available languages for your wallet's seed: If your display freezes, exit blind with ^C, then run again with --use-english-language-names 0 : Deutsch 1 : English 2 : Espa\u00f1ol 3 : Fran\u00e7ais 4 : Italiano 5 : Nederlands 6 : Portugu\u00eas 7 : \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a 8 : \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e 9 : \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 (\u4e2d\u56fd) 10 : Esperanto 11 : Lojban Enter the number corresponding to the language of your choice: 1 The loki-wallet-cli will generate and spit out several lines of text. Some of the information that was outputted will only ever show once, therefore it is very important to do this next section properly otherwise we may lose access to our account, thus losing access to our funds. Let\u2019s take a close look at each section of the newly generated wallet: The text after Generated new wallet shows your public address. This address can be shared and will be used to receive Loki to your wallet. All Loki public addresses start with an L.... and are followed with a string of characters. The public address shown will be your primary address however multiple public addresses can be generated from this primary address. You do not need to write down the public address, the command address will re-display it whenever required. Generated new wallet: LAXk6eS3Ng98QxDTdC47eNdfCXttJycKraXxfsw9cMVngGUqP3kiSE6cwXoApU6gjzSXVX1ASAPAi1MSXA935XUs1MWEcv9 The View key address is not to be shared unless you want to show the transactions received to the public address connected to this wallet. You do not need to write down the view key as it can be re-displayed with the command viewkey . View key: 97d3c27e20818e5e23a6548458b50d4f128a2709c55eb7f9518d0e957a5d2e0d The next few lines of text show how to navigate the loki-wallet-client . This user guide will look into more detail the commands that can be used within the loki-wallet-client further in the guide. Your wallet has been generated! To start synchronizing with the daemon, use the \"refresh\" command. Use the \"help\" command to see the list of available commands. Use \"help <command>\" to see a command's documentation. Always use the \"exit\" command when closing loki-wallet-cli to save your current session's state. Otherwise, you might need to synchronize your wallet again (your wallet keys are NOT at risk in any case). The next section with the random 25 words is your mnemonic seed. The seed is used to easily back-up and restore your wallet without needing any other information. At this stage, grab a pen and paper and write down your 25 words in order(having these words out of order will not restore your wallet) and store the piece of paper in a safe and secure place. If your words are stored in a text file on your computer or stored online, you increase your risk of someone else getting control of your account. NOTE: the following 25 words can be used to recover access to your wallet. Write them down and store them somewhere safe and secure. Please do not store them in your email or on file storage services outside of your immediate control. ponies innocent oyster whale autumn knapsack jostle elapse inroads joining doorway ticket drying obnoxious algebra tutor biplane sack alpine zinger huge duets refer rigid inroads The last of the outputs are the account balance, because your wallet does not have any Loki in it currently the balance is showing 0.
